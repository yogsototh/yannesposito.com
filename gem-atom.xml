# Your org-agenda at your homepage

During most of the day my emacs is open.
But I sometime forget to look at my org-agenda.
This is why I wanted to find another way to be exposed to it.

And one thing I am mostly exposed to is my personal start page.
This is just the default page I see when I open my browser.

Here is the end result:

attr_org:  :width 560
attr_html:  Generate HTML from the Agenda
caption:  The result inside my start page
name:  fig:agenda-html
=> ./agenda-html.png


My start page is named /mothership/.
And I just put the org-agenda at the top of the page inside an iframe.
I have a service that start a server on localhost and I configured my
browser to use it as startup page.
That's it.

So now, here is how to sync my org-agenda on this start page.

In my ~config.el~:

```elisp
(setq y/mothership "~/dev/mothership/")
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      `(("g" "Plan Today"
         ((agenda "" ((org-agenda-span 'day))))
         nil
         ( ,(concat y/mothership "/agenda.html") ))))
```

This provide a custom org agenda command and link that custom command to
the export file =~/dev/mothership/agenda.html=.

And a shell script:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
emacs --batch \
  --load "$HOME/.emacs.d/init.el" \
  --eval '(org-batch-store-agenda-views)' \
  --kill
```

```bash
*/5 * * * * /Users/esposito/dev/mothership/export-agenda.sh
```

And finally in my start-page html I just need to add an iframe like so:

```html
<iframe id="agenda" src="gemini://her.esy.fun/posts/0022-org-agenda-on-your-startup-page/agenda.html"></iframe>
```

But as I also want to be able to toggle the agenda, and auto-resize the
iframe.
So I added a bit of js code:

```html
<div id="agendatoggle">[-]</div><br/>
<script>
function resizeIframe(iframe) {
  iframe.height = ( iframe.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 30) + "px";
}
</script>
<iframe id="agenda" src="gemini://her.esy.fun/posts/0022-org-agenda-on-your-startup-page/agenda.html" onload="resizeIframe(this)"></iframe>
</div>
<script>

function hideAgenda () {
  let agenda = document.getElementById("agenda");
  agenda.style.display = 'none';
  let at = document.getElementById("agendatoggle");
  at.innerHTML="agenda [+]";
  at.onclick = showAgenda;
}

function showAgenda () {
  let agenda = document.getElementById("agenda");
  agenda.style.display = 'block';
  resizeIframe(agenda);
  // setInterval(function(){ ; }, 1000);
  let at = document.getElementById("agendatoggle");
  at.innerHTML="agenda [-]";
  at.onclick = hideAgenda;
}

showAgenda();
</script>
```

And that's it.
That's a neat trick, and so I'm glad to put a small post about it.
## Bonuses
### auto-resize iframe

In order to auto-resize the iframe you must have a non =file:///= URL in the browser.
So you must serve your start page.
After a lot of different way to serve my pages, I finally use ~lighttpd~
inside a ~nix-shell~.

So I added the following to my startpage code:

A => ./lighttpd.conf file

```conf :tangle lighttpd.conf
server.bind = "127.0.0.1"
server.port = 31337
server.document-root = var.CWD

index-file.names = ( "index.html" )

mimetype.assign = (
  ".css"        =>  "text/css",
  ".gif"        =>  "image/gif",
  ".htm"        =>  "text/html",
  ".html"       =>  "text/html",
  ".jpeg"       =>  "image/jpeg",
  ".jpg"        =>  "image/jpeg",
  ".js"         =>  "text/javascript",
  ".png"        =>  "image/png",
  ".swf"        =>  "application/x-shockwave-flash",
  ".txt"        =>  "text/plain",
  ".gmi"        =>  "text/plain",
  ".svg"        =>  "image/svg+xml",
  ".svgz"       =>  "image/svg+xml"
)

# Making sure file uploads above 64k always work when using IE or Safari
# For more information, see http://trac.lighttpd.net/trac/ticket/360
$HTTP["useragent"] =~ "^(.*MSIE.*)|(.*AppleWebKit.*)$" {
  server.max-keep-alive-requests = 0
}
```

With a

```bash :tangle serve.sh
#! /user/bin/env nix-shell
#! nix-shell shell.nix -i bash
webdir="_site"
port="$(grep server.port ./lighttpd.conf|sed 's/[^0-9]*//')"
echo "Serving: $webdir on http://localhost:$port" && \
lighttpd -f ./lighttpd.conf -D
```

I have a frozen nixpkgs dependencies via =niv=.
But you could probably simply replace the line by:

```
#! nix-shell -p lighttpd -i bash
```

And it should work fine.

### Start your server at startup on macOS

Last but not least, starting this start page server when I login.

So for that you should demonize with launchd.

I created a => ./y.mothership.plist file to put in =~/Library/LauchAgents/=:

```xml :tangle y.mothership.plist
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>mothership</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/bin/zsh</string>
        <string>-c</string>
        <string>$HOME/y/mothership/serve.sh</string>
    </array>
    <key>StandardOutPath</key>
    <string>/var/log/mothership.log</string>
    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
    <string>/var/log/mothership.log</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Then to ensure that the executable ~nix-shell~ is present in the PATH for the
demon, I ran:

```
launchctl config user path "$PATH"
```

This will affect the path of all users, but as I am the only user on my
computer this is fine for me.

Then:

```
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/y.mothership.plist
launchctl start mothership
```


And that's about it.

# My personal environment sync
description: 
keywords:  programming
author:  Yann Esposito
email:  yann@esposito.host
=> /files/publickey.txt gpg
date:  [2021-10-30 Sat]

I have a quite specific system that I improved along the years to manage my
local environment.
Think about, binaries I expect to have in my shell, as well as
configuration files for various utilities, and a few personal scripts.

The notion of what is exactly my local environment is not perfectly defined.
I expect every of my computers to behave slightly differently.
Some are for work-only, some personal use only.

For the things I want everywhere, I have a peculiar personal system.

I use a personal script that depends on

=> https://yadm.io yadm
 and

=> https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager home-manager

My script try to check if some files where updated and react accordingly:

1. I download the dot-files changes via =yadm=.
2. If my home-manager files changes, it will run ~home-manager switch~
   ; if it fails, try to update nix channels then try again.
3. If my doom emacs packages changed, it will run ~doom sync~
4. If the script itself changed, it re-run the script after updating itself.

If the script detect that I changed my emacs configuration, it runs ~doom
sync~ or ~doom sync -u~.

Here it is:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

## Bootstrapping

Bootstrapping this system is always a nice problem to think about.
It is smooth when everything is set but to bootstrap it I need binaries
installed by this system...
So...
How to handle the dependency cycle correctly?

To minimize the pain, I removed more and more bootstrapping dependencies.
Now my almost single dependence for bootstrapping my environment is =nix=.
I haven't initialized any machine for a long time now.
The following should work.

0. Use fish[fn:fish]  ~chsh /bin/fish~
1. Install nix
   ~curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh~
2. Install home-manager
   ```bash
   nix-channel --add https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/archive/release-21.05.tar.gz home-manager
   nix-channel --update
   export NIX_PATH=$HOME/.nix-defexpr/channels${NIX_PATH:+:}$NIX_PATH
   nix-shell '<home-manager>' -A install
   ```
3. Install and use ~yadm~
   ```bash
   nix-shell -p yadm
   yadm boostrap
   yadm remote set-url origin <url-to-my-dot-files-repo>
   yadm pull
   ```
4. Still in the =nix-shell= with =yadm= run ~~/bin/sync-env.sh~


There is a risk that step 3 fail because I pin most of my packages in
home-manager configuration, and it will try to install =yadm=. This can
conflict with the =yadm= installed in the current =nix-shell=.
So sometime I need to:

1. Remove the line installing =yadm= in my home-manager configuration first
2. run =home-manager sync=
3. get out of the =nix-shell=,
4. add =yadm= back in the =home-manager= config
5. run =home-manager sync= again, but this time out of the =nix-shell=.
6. Finally I can run my =~/bin/sync-env.sh= command.

So this post will probably be useful as a personal note in the future.
Because bootstrapping is generally not trivial.
I will probably update this post if something is missing.

[fn:fish] I use fish for interactive shell. I use ~zsh~ for quick dirty
scripts (a lot better than bash), and I switch to

=> https://hackage.haskell.org/package/turtle turtle
 if I need to be
serious about the script.

So I played with tweaking my emacs configuration again.
I think I made something worth to be shared.
I wanted to have the same effect than in iA writer within emacs.
And I just reached this.

So the effect I am looking to achieve can be seen in this video.

It highlight the current sentence (in black) while the rest of the text is
gray.
The main issue with the =hl-sentence= package alone is that it set a specific
face to the current sentence, but does not affect the other text in the
buffer.
In fact to make it work as I would expect, you need to make the default
color grey, and only set black for the highlighted text.

Fortunately, I have recently created a personal theme close to that.
I just created a new specific one.
Everything is mostly "gray" except the font ~hl-sentence~ which is black.

And that's it.
So to make it all work I need.

* a Gray theme,
* the package ~hl-sentence~,
* the ~writeroom~ package.

So how to achieve that yourself?
Here is how I do it.

## The zen-writer theme

Download

=> ./doom-zen-writer-theme.el Doom Zen-Writer theme
This depend on doom-themes and here is the code of the theme.
Just put it in you =~/.doom.d/themes= directory.

## add this is your ~packages.el~

```elisp
(package! hl-sentence
  :pin "86ae38d3103bd20da5485cbdd59dfbd396c45ee4")
```
## Helpers

You probably want to be able to put you out of this writing mode.
Here is a

=> zen-writer.el zen-writer.el
 file that contain my keymaps and useful functions.

Put it in you =~/.doom.d/= directory and in you =config.el=
put

```emacs-lisp
(load! "~/.doom.d/zen-writer.el")
```

And with this you should pass to zen mode with ~SPC y z z~.

To make the un-zen works.
You will need to have a ~y/auto-update-theme~ function that set your current theme.
My function change the theme depending on the time of the day or the day of
the week.

So here it is for inspiration:

```emacs-lisp
(defun y/auto-update-theme ()
  "depending on time use different theme"
  ;; very early => gruvbox-light, solarized-light, nord-light
  (let* ((day-of-week (format-time-string "%a"))
         (week-end? (or (equal "Sat" day-of-week)
                        (equal "Sun" day-of-week)))
         (hour (nth 2 (decode-time (current-time))))
         (time-to-sleep? (or (> hour 22) (< hour 7)))

         (theme (cond
                 (time-to-sleep?  'doom-plain-dark)
                 (week-end?       'doom-nord-light)
                 ((<= 7 hour 8)   'doom-gruvbox-light)
                 ((= 9 hour)      'doom-solarized-light)
                 ((<= 10 hour 16) 'doom-solarized-white)
                 ((<= 17 hour 18) 'doom-gruvbox-light)
                 ((<= 19 hour 22) 'doom-oceanic-next))))
    (when (not (equal doom-theme theme))
      (setq doom-theme theme)
      (load-theme doom-theme t))
    ;; run that function again next hour
    (run-at-time (format "%02d:%02d" (+ hour 1) 0) nil 'y/auto-update-theme)))
```

## Bonus

I use Nerd Fonts and in particular the font `iMWritingDuoS` which is I
think a clone of the iAWriter font.

```emacs-lisp
(setq doom-variable-pitch-font
      (font-spec :family "iMWritingDuoS Nerd Font" :size 12))
```

I hope you find this useful.
I really like how it looks now.

# Cool looking org-mode
description:  A configuration to make org-mode look even better.

______
TL;DR: My tweaked configuration to make org-mode even more pleasant to use.
______

## The code

At the end of this article there is a long digression about why I ended up here.
But instead of bothering you with the why here is a what it looks like, and
how to achieve it.

First you need to install some dependencies.

1. Install nerdfonts[fn:nerdfonts]
2. Tell org-mode to use =variable-pitch-mode= (variable width font)
3. Use ~(setq org-hide-emphasis-markers t)~
4. Configure a lot of org-mode specific faces to still use a monospaced font.

Here are some images of the result.
Notice one important factor of the feel is that I work on a mac with retina
display.
Often font rendering feel too bold by default.
But this is perfect to have a writing environment even if screenshot does
not look as slick as other ones, the usage is superior.

attr_org:  :width 560
attr_html:  top
caption:  org-mode headers
name:  fig:top
=> ./top.png
attr_org:  :width 560
attr_html:  img-with-caption
caption:  org-mode some inline image
name:  fig:img-with-caption
=> ./img-with-caption.png

attr_org:  :width 560
attr_html:  code
caption:  org-mode with some code block
name:  fig:img-with-caption
=> ./code.png

attr_org:  :width 560
attr_html:  Org mode with a modified doom-solarized light theme (use a grey background)
caption:  Org mode with a modified doom-solarized light theme (use a grey background)
name:  fig:nano-emacs
=> ./y-org-mode.png

The main trick is to change org-mode to use different font depending on the
kind of bloc.
I use two fonts variant which are an iA Writer clone fonts; iM Writing Nerd Font.

First you need to install nerd-fonts[fn:nerdfonts].
You will get that =iMWritingDuoS Nerd Font=.
If you look at the code block; I support the case when the font is
not installed and fall back to Georgia or PT Serif.
One nice little bonus of the config is to make the fixed width fonts smaller.
This is often something I like when writing in org-mode.

There is a minor dependency on =doom= as I use =doom-color= for the color of
the links.
But you could easily use any color you like if you do not use doom.

```emacs-lisp
(setq org-ellipsis " [+]")
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'variable-pitch-mode)
(let* ((variable-tuple
        (cond
         ((x-list-fonts "iMWritingDuoS Nerd Font")   '(:family "iMWritingDuoS Nerd Font"))
         ((x-list-fonts "Georgia")   '(:family "Georgia"))
         ((x-list-fonts "PT Serif")  '(:family "PT Serif"))))
       (fixed-tuple
        (cond
         ((x-list-fonts "iMWritingDuoS Nerd Font Mono")   '(:family "iMWritingDuoS Nerd Font Mono"   :height 160))
         ((x-list-fonts "Menlo")               '(:family "Menlo"    :height 120))
         ((x-list-fonts "PT Mono")             '(:family "PT Mono"  :height 120))))
       (headline `(:inherit default :weight bold)))
  (custom-theme-set-faces
   'user
   `(org-level-1 ((t (,@headline ,@variable-tuple))))
   `(org-level-2 ((t (,@headline ,@variable-tuple))))
   `(org-level-3 ((t (,@headline ,@variable-tuple))))
   `(org-level-4 ((t (,@headline ,@variable-tuple))))
   `(org-level-5 ((t (,@headline ,@variable-tuple))))
   `(org-level-6 ((t (,@headline ,@variable-tuple))))
   `(org-level-7 ((t (,@headline ,@variable-tuple))))
   `(org-level-8 ((t (,@headline ,@variable-tuple))))
   `(org-document-title ((t (,@headline ,@variable-tuple))))

   `(variable-pitch     ((t ,@variable-tuple)))
   `(fixed-pitch        ((t ,@fixed-tuple)))

   '(org-ellipsis ((t (:inherit fixed-pitch :foreground "gray40" :underline nil))))
   '(org-block            ((t (:inherit fixed-pitch))))
   '(org-block-begin-line ((t (:inherit fixed-pitch))))
   '(org-block-end-line   ((t (:inherit fixed-pitch))))
   '(org-src              ((t (:inherit fixed-pitch))))
   '(org-properties       ((t (:inherit fixed-pitch))))
   '(org-code             ((t (:inherit (shadow fixed-pitch)))))
   '(org-date             ((t (:inherit (shadow fixed-pitch)))))
   '(org-document-info    ((t (:inherit (shadow fixed-pitch)))))
   '(org-document-info-keyword ((t (:inherit (shadow fixed-pitch)))))
   '(org-drawer           ((t (:inherit (shadow fixed-pitch)))))
   '(org-indent           ((t (:inherit (org-hide fixed-pitch)))))
   `(org-link             ((t (:inherit fixed-pitch :foreground ,(doom-color 'blue) :underline t))))
   '(org-meta-line        ((t (:inherit (font-lock-comment-face fixed-pitch)))))
   '(org-property-value   ((t (:inherit fixed-pitch))) t)
   '(org-special-keyword  ((t (:inherit (font-lock-comment-face fixed-pitch)))))
   '(org-table            ((t (:inherit fixed-pitch))))
   '(org-tag              ((t (:inherit (shadow fixed-pitch) :weight bold :height 0.8))))
   '(org-verbatim         ((t (:inherit (shadow fixed-pitch)))))))
```

## Digression about why I did that;

For some reason a went to the rabbit hole of tweaking my emacs.
In fact, it first started as; let's try to switch from
=doom-emacs=[fn:doom-emacs] to =nano-emacs=[fn:nano-emacs].
But, doing so, I realized I wouldn't be able to reach the quality and
optimization provided by doom-emacs myself.
So instead of doing this, I first tried to copy the theme of nano.
Then I realized one of the biggest factor of nano look & feel was
its usage of "Roboto Mono" but with weight light (or Thin).

See

attr_org:  :width 560
attr_html:  nano-emacs look (light theme)
caption:  GNU Emacs / N Λ N O Look (light theme)
name:  fig:nano-emacs
=> ./nano-emacs-light.png



attr_org:  :width 560
attr_html:  nano-emacs look (dark theme)
caption:  GNU Emacs / N Λ N O Look (dark theme)
name:  fig:nano-emacs
=> ./nano-emacs-dark.png

OK so...
I just tried to match the theme colors.
It was easy to create a theme with matching colors.
*But*, to make it really looks like nano; almost monochrome with two accent
colors; it would mean a lot more work than anyone could expect.
For most emacs mode you probably need to add a set of specific font faces.
This choice is also what makes nano looks so good too.
This is not just about the color, but about a lot more details than that.
Using the good colors only at the right place is difficult to achieve.
And not only the colors, but also, the correct fonts, the spacing of text
elements etc...

Unfortunately if you want the nano look and feel in doom, it is much more
work than just copying the nano theme.

But this research of look and feel opened the door to using thin fonts in
emacs.
And also tweaking the fonts which really improve the look & feel of emacs.

With this conf, I do not use the same font for coding and for writing
prose or a blog post with code blocks.
So far, I like this new look and feel.

## Bonuses

### Thin Code fonts

After lot of try, I finally switched my default coding font to SauceCodePro
Nerd Font Mono with weight ~semi-light~.
This is a clone of Adobe =SourceCode Pro=.
And on a retina display it is really nice to use.

```emacs-lisp
(setq doom-font (font-spec :family "SauceCodePro Nerd Font Mono" :size 12 :weight 'semi-light)
      doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "iMWritingDuoS Nerd Font" :size 14))
```

### An unfinished nano theme for doom

Even though the result is not 100% satisfactory, you could start using my work.

```

You will probably need more work to achieve the colors you expect.
For that, using ~SPC-u C-x =~ will probably be useful.
It will show the font face under the cursor.

Best of luck.

I wanted to write a few articles about great shows lot of people around me
do not know about.


=> https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/46511-utopia Utopia (2013)
 is one of these TV Shows that deserve more attention.

The *filmography* is quite original.
I have never seen another film/TV show with a similar atmosphere.
The usage of bright colors is magistral.
Flashy yellow, green, red.

The *soundtrack* is also pretty surprising original and enjoyable.

The *acting* is really great.
Actors are doing a great job and are quite relatable.
These are not the (super)heroes you are used to.
We are far away from shows where every girl is a bimbo and every guy is a
Chippendale.

The *scenario*, in regard to the recent events related to COVID19 is just perfect.
I do not want to reveal too much.
But let's just say the current real events are close to the events
predicted in this show.

The *Surrealistic Humor* atmosphere make the viewing experience quite
exceptionnal.
There is a mix between nonchalance and extreme violence.
It really feels surrealist.
In this show some people act with extreme violence as if there is no choice.

As a conclusion, if you are looking for a very innovative TV show then
search no further this one is a great original choice.
If you are still unsure, just watch the opening scene, it is quite incredible.

ps: Also try to get the original content. Amazon Prime apparently cut some
very important scene and also changed the ratio which hurt the very good
image work.

# Fast Static Site with make
description:  A deeper view of my static site builder Makefile
keywords:  blog static
author:  Yann Esposito
email:  yann@esposito.host
=> /files/publickey.txt gpg
date:  [2021-05-25 Tue]

This article will dig a bit deeper about my =Makefile= based static website generator.
In a

=> https://her.esy.fun/posts/0017-static-blog-builder/index.html previous article
 I just gave the rationale and an overview to do it
yourself.
Mainly it is very fast and portable.

A few goals reached by my current build system are:

1. Be fast and make the minimal amount of work as possible.
   I don't want to rebuild all the html pages if I only change one file.
2. Source file format agnostic. You can use markdown, org-mode or even
   directly write html.
3. Support gemini
4. Optimize size: minify HTML, CSS, images
5. Generate an index page listing the posts
6. Generate RSS/atom feed (for both gemini and http)

=make= will take care of handling the dependency graph to minimize
the amount of effort when a change occurs in the sources.
For some features, I built specifics small shell scripts.
For example to be absolutely agnostic in the source format for my articles
I generate the RSS out of a tree of HTML files.
But taking advantage of =make=, I generate an index cache to transform those
HTML into XML which will be faster to use to build different indexes.
To make those transformations I use very short a shell scripts.

# =Makefile= overview

A Makefile is made out of rules.
The first rule of your Makefile will be the default rule.
The first rule of my Makefile is called =all=.

A rule as the following format:

```makefile
target: file1 file2
	cmd --input file1 file2 \
		--output target
```

if =target= does not exists, then =make= will look at its dependencies.
If any of its dependencies need to be updated, it will run all the rules in
the correct order to rebuild them and finally run the script to build
=target=.
A file needs to be updated if one of its dependency needs to be updated or is
newer.

The usual use case of =make= is about building a single binary out of many
source files.
But for a static website, we need to generate a lot of files from a lot of
files.
So we construct the rules like this:

```makefile
all: site

# build a list of files that will need to be build
DST_FILES := ....
# RULES TO GENERATE DST_FILES
ALL += $(DST_FILES)

# another list of files
DST_FILES_2 := ....
# RULES TO GENERATE DST_FILES_2
ALL += $(DST_FILES_2)

site: $(ALL)
```

In my =Makefile= I have many similar block with the same pattern.

1. I retrieve a list of source files
2. I construct the list of destination files (change the directory, the extension)
3. I declare a rule to construct these destination files
4. I add the destination files to the =ALL= variable.

I have a block for:
* raw assets I just want copied
* images I would like to compress for the web
* =html= I would like to generate from org mode files via pandoc
* =gmi= I would like to generate from org mode files
* =xml= files I use as cache to build different index files
* =index.html= file containing a list of my posts
* =rss.xml= file containing a list of my posts
* =gemini-atom.xml= file containing a list of my posts

## Assets

The rules to copy assets will be a good first example.

1. find all assets in =src/= directory
2. generate all assets from these files in =_site/= directory
3. make this rule a dependency on the =all= rule.


```makefile
SRC_ASSETS := $(shell find src -type f)
DST_ASSETS := $(patsubst src/%,_site/%,$(SRC_ASSETS))
_site/% : src/%
	@mkdir -p "$(dir $@)"
	cp "$<" "$@"
.PHONY: assets
assets: $(DST_ASSETS)
ALL += assets
```

OK, this looks terrible.
But mainly:

* ~SRC_ASSETS~ will contain the result of the command ~find~.
* ~DST_ASSETS~ will contain the files of ~SRC_ASSETS~  but we replace the
  =src/= by =_site/=.
* We create a generic rule; for all files matching the following pattern
  =_site/%=, look for the file =src/%= and if it is newer (in our case)
  then execute the following commands:
  - create the directory to put =_site/%= in
  - copy the file

About the line ~@mkdir -p "$(dir $@)"~:
* the =@= at the start of the command simply means that we make this execution silent.
* The =$@= is replaced by the target string.
* And =$(dir $@)= will generate the folder name of =$@=.

For the line with ~cp~, you just need to know that =~$<~= will represent the
first dependency.

My Makefile is composed of similar blocks, where I replace the first
find command to match specific files and where I use different building rules.
An important point is that the rules must be the most specific possible.
This is because =make= will use the most specific rule in case of ambiguity.
For example, the matching rule =_site/%: src/%= will match all files in
the =src/= dir.
But if we want to treat =CSS= files with another rule we could write:

```makefile
_site/%.css: src/%.css
	minify "$<" "$@"
```

And if the selected file is a =CSS= file, this rule will be selected.

## Prelude

I start with variables declarations:

```makefile
all: site
# directory containing the source files
SRC_DIR ?= src
# directory that will contain the site files
DST_DIR ?= _site
# a directory that will contain a cache to speedup indexing
CACHE_DIR ?= .cache

# options to pass to find to prevent matching files in the src/drafts
# directory
NO_DRAFT := -not -path '$(SRC_DIR)/drafts/*'
# option to pass to find to not match  org files
NO_SRC_FILE := ! -name '*.org'
```

## CSS

Here we go; the same simple pattern for CSS files.

```makefile
# CSS
SRC_CSS_FILES := $(shell find $(SRC_DIR) -type f -name '*.css')
DST_CSS_FILES := $(patsubst $(SRC_DIR)/%,$(DST_DIR)/%,$(SRC_RAW_FILES))
$(DST_DIR)/%.css : $(SRC_DIR)/%.css
	@mkdir -p "$(dir $@)"
	minify "$<" > "$@"
.PHONY: css
css: $(DST_CSS_FILES)
ALL += css
```

This is very similar to the block for raw assets.
The difference is just that instead of using =cp= we use the =minify=
command.

## ORG → HTML

Now this one is more complex but is still follow the same pattern.

```makefile
# ORG -> HTML
EXT ?= .org
SRC_PANDOC_FILES ?= $(shell find $(SRC_DIR) -type f -name "*$(EXT)" $(NO_DRAFT))
DST_PANDOC_FILES ?= $(patsubst %$(EXT),%.html, \
                        $(patsubst $(SRC_DIR)/%,$(DST_DIR)/%, \
                            $(SRC_PANDOC_FILES)))
PANDOC_TEMPLATE ?= templates/post.html
MK_HTML := engine/mk-html.sh
PANDOC := $(MK_HTML) $(PANDOC_TEMPLATE)
$(DST_DIR)/%.html: $(SRC_DIR)/%.org $(PANDOC_TEMPLATE) $(MK_HTML)
	@mkdir -p "$(dir $@)"
	$(PANDOC) "$<" "$@.tmp"
	minify --mime text/html "$@.tmp" > "$@"
	@rm "$@.tmp"
.PHONY: html
html: $(DST_PANDOC_FILES)
ALL += html
```

So to construct =DST_PANDOC_FILES= this time we also need to change the
extension of the file from =org= to =html=.
We need to provide a template that will be passed to pandoc.

And of course, as if we change the template file we would like to
regenerate all HTML files we put the template as a dependency.
But importantly *not* at the first place. Because we use =$<= that will be
the first dependency.

I also have a short script instead of directly using =pandoc=.
It is easier to handle =toc= using the metadatas in the file.
And if someday I want to put the template in the metas, this will be the
right place to put that.

The =mk-html.sh= is quite straightforward:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -eu

# put me at the top level of my project (like Makefile)
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" || exit 1
template="$1"
orgfile="$2"
htmlfile="$3"

# check if there is the #+OPTIONS: toc:t
tocoption=""
if grep -ie '^#+options:' "$orgfile" | grep 'toc:t'>/dev/null; then
    tocoption="--toc"
fi

set -x
pandoc $tocoption \
       --template="$template" \
       --mathml \
       --from org \
       --to html5 \
       --standalone \
       $orgfile \
       --output "$htmlfile"
```

Once generated I also minify the html file.
And, that's it.
But the important part is that now, if I change my script or the template
or the file, it will generate the dependencies.
## Indexes

We often need indexes to build a website.
Typically to list the latest articles, build the RSS file.
So for sake of simplicity, I decided to build my index as a set of XML files.
Of course, this could be optimizide, by using SQLite for example.
But this will already be really fast.

For every generated html file I will generate a clean XML file with
=hxclean=.
Once cleaned, it will be easy to access a specific node of in these XML files.

```makefile
# INDEXES
SRC_POSTS_DIR ?= $(SRC_DIR)/posts
DST_POSTS_DIR ?= $(DST_DIR)/posts
SRC_POSTS_FILES ?= $(shell find $(SRC_POSTS_DIR) -type f -name "*$(EXT)")
RSS_CACHE_DIR ?= $(CACHE_DIR)/rss
DST_XML_FILES ?= $(patsubst %.org,%.xml, \
                        $(patsubst $(SRC_POSTS_DIR)/%,$(RSS_CACHE_DIR)/%, \
                            $(SRC_POSTS_FILES)))
$(RSS_CACHE_DIR)/%.xml: $(DST_POSTS_DIR)/%.html
	@mkdir -p "$(dir $@)"
	hxclean "$<" > "$@"
.PHONY: indexcache
indexcache: $(DST_XML_FILES)
ALL += indexcache
```

This rule will generate for every file in =site/posts/*.html= a corresponding
=xml= file (=hxclean= takes an HTML an try its best to make an XML out of it).

## HTML Index

Now we just want to generate the main =index.html= page at the root of
the site.
This page should list all articles by date in reverse order.

The first step is to take advantage of the cache index.
For every XML file I generated before I should generate the small HTML
block I want for every entry.
For this I use a script =mk-index-entry.sh=.
He will use =hxselect= to retrieve the date and the title from the cached
XML files.
Then generate a small file just containing the date and the link.

Here is the block in the Makefile:

```makefile
DST_INDEX_FILES ?= $(patsubst %.xml,%.index, $(DST_XML_FILES))
MK_INDEX_ENTRY := ./engine/mk-index-entry.sh
INDEX_CACHE_DIR ?= $(CACHE_DIR)/rss
$(INDEX_CACHE_DIR)/%.index: $(INDEX_CACHE_DIR)/%.xml $(MK_INDEX_ENTRY)
	@mkdir -p $(INDEX_CACHE_DIR)
	$(MK_INDEX_ENTRY) "$<" "$@"
```

It means: for every =.xml= file generate a =.index= file with
=mk-index-entry.sh=.

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env zsh

# prelude
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" || exit 1
xfic="$1"
dst="$2"
indexdir=".cache/rss"

# HTML Accessors (similar to CSS accessors)
dateaccessor='.yyydate'
# title and keyword shouldn't be changed
titleaccessor='title'
finddate(){ < $1 hxselect -c $dateaccessor | sed 's/\[//g;s/\]//g;s/ .*$//' }
findtitle(){ < $1 hxselect -c $titleaccessor }

autoload -U colors && colors

blogfile="$(echo "$xfic"|sed 's#.xml$#.html#;s#^'$indexdir'/#posts/#')"
printf "%-30s" $blogfile
d=$(finddate $xfic)
echo -n " [$d]"
rssdate=$(formatdate $d)
title=$(findtitle $xfic)
keywords=( $(findkeywords $xfic) )
printf ": %-55s" "$title ($keywords)"
{ printf "\\n<li>"
  printf "\\n<span class=\"pubDate\">%s</span>" "$d"
  printf "\\n<a href=\"%s\">%s</a>" "${blogfile}" "$title"
  printf "\\n</li>\\n\\n"
} >> ${dst}

echo " [${fg[green]}OK${reset_color}]"
```

Then I use these intermediate files to generate a single bigger index file.

```makefile
HTML_INDEX := $(DST_DIR)/index.html
MKINDEX := engine/mk-index.sh
INDEX_TEMPLATE ?= templates/index.html
$(HTML_INDEX): $(DST_INDEX_FILES) $(MKINDEX) $(INDEX_TEMPLATE)
	@mkdir -p $(DST_DIR)
	$(MKINDEX)
.PHONY: index
index: $(HTML_INDEX)
ALL += index
```

This script is a big one, but it is not that complex.
For every file, I generate a new file =DATE-dirname=.
I sort them in reverse order and put their content in the middle of an HTML
file.

Important note: this file updates only if the index change.

The first part of the script creates files with the creation date in their
metadatas.
The created file name will contain the creation date, this will be helpful
later.

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env zsh

autoload -U colors && colors
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" || exit 1
# Directory
webdir="_site"
indexfile="$webdir/index.html"
indexdir=".cache/rss"
tmpdir=$(mktemp -d)

echo "Publishing"

dateaccessor='.pubDate'
finddate(){ < $1 hxselect -c $dateaccessor }
# generate files with <DATE>-<FILENAME>.index
for fic in $indexdir/**/*.index; do
    d=$(finddate $fic)
    echo "${${fic:h}:t} [$d]"
    cp $fic $tmpdir/$d-${${fic:h}:t}.index
done
```

Then I use these files to generate a file that will contain the =body= of
the HTML.

```sh
# for every post in reverse order
# generate the body (there is some logic to group by year)
previousyear=""
for fic in $(ls $tmpdir/*.index | sort -r); do
    d=$(finddate $fic)
    year=$( echo "$d" | perl -pe 's#(\d{4})-.*#$1#')
    if (( year != previousyear )); then
        if (( previousyear > 0 )); then
            echo "</ul>" >> $tmpdir/index
        fi
        previousyear=$year
        echo "<h3 name=\"${year}\" >${year}</h3><ul>" >> $tmpdir/index
    fi
    cat $fic >> $tmpdir/index
done
echo "</ul>" >> $tmpdir/index
```

And finally, I render the HTML using a template within a shell script:

```sh
title="Y"
description="Most recent articles"
author="Yann Esposito"
body=$(< $tmpdir/index)
date=$(LC_TIME=en_US date +'%Y-%m-%d')

# A neat trick to use pandoc template within a shell script
# the pandoc templates use $x$ format, we replace it by just $x
# to be used with envsubst
template=$(< templates/index.html | \
    sed 's/\$\(header-includes\|table-of-content\)\$//' | \
    sed 's/\$if.*\$//' | \
    perl -pe 's#(\$[^\$]*)\$#$1#g' )
{
    export title
    export author
    export description
    export date
    export body
    echo ${template} | envsubst
} > "$indexfile"

rm -rf $tmpdir
echo "* HTML INDEX [done]"
```

## RSS

My RSS generation is similar to the system I used to generate the index
file.
I just slightly improved the rules.

The =Makefile= blocks look like:

```makefile
# RSS
DST_RSS_FILES ?= $(patsubst %.xml,%.rss, $(DST_XML_FILES))
MK_RSS_ENTRY := ./engine/mk-rss-entry.sh
$(RSS_CACHE_DIR)/%.rss: $(RSS_CACHE_DIR)/%.xml $(MK_RSS_ENTRY)
	@mkdir -p $(RSS_CACHE_DIR)
	$(MK_RSS_ENTRY) "$<" "$@"

RSS := $(DST_DIR)/rss.xml
MKRSS := engine/mkrss.sh
$(RSS): $(DST_RSS_FILES) $(MKRSS)
	$(MKRSS)

.PHONY: rss
rss: $(RSS)
ALL += rss
```
## Gemini

I wrote a minimal script to transform my org files to gemini files.
I also need to generate an index and an atom file for gemini:

```makefile
# ORG -> GEMINI
EXT := .org
SRC_GMI_FILES ?= $(shell find $(SRC_DIR) -type f -name "*$(EXT)" $(NO_DRAFT))
DST_GMI_FILES ?= $(subst $(EXT),.gmi, \
                        $(patsubst $(SRC_DIR)/%,$(DST_DIR)/%, \
                            $(SRC_GMI_FILES)))
GMI := engine/org2gemini.sh
$(DST_DIR)/%.gmi: $(SRC_DIR)/%.org $(GMI) engine/org2gemini_step1.sh
	@mkdir -p $(dir $@)
	$(GMI) "$<" "$@"
ALL += $(DST_GMI_FILES)
.PHONY: gmi
gmi: $(DST_GMI_FILES)

# GEMINI INDEX
GMI_INDEX := $(DST_DIR)/index.gmi
MK_GMI_INDEX := engine/mk-gemini-index.sh
$(GMI_INDEX): $(DST_GMI_FILES) $(MK_GMI_INDEX)
	@mkdir -p $(DST_DIR)
	$(MK_GMI_INDEX)
ALL += $(GMI_INDEX)
.PHONY: gmi-index
gmi-index: $(GMI_INDEX)

# RSS
GEM_ATOM := $(DST_DIR)/gem-atom.xml
MK_GEMINI_ATOM := engine/mk-gemini-atom.sh
$(GEM_ATOM): $(DST_GMI_FILES) $(MK_GEMINI_ATOM)
	$(MK_GEMINI_ATOM)
ALL += $(GEM_ATOM)
.PHONY: gmi-atom
gmi-atom: $(GMI_ATOM)

.PHONY: gemini
gemini: $(DST_GMI_FILES) $(GMI_INDEX) $(GEM_ATOM)
```
## Images

For images, I try to compress them all with imagemagick.

```makefile
# Images
SRC_IMG_FILES ?= $(shell find $(SRC_DIR) -type f -name "*.jpg" -or -name "*.jpeg" -or -name "*.gif" -or -name "*.png")
DST_IMG_FILES ?= $(patsubst $(SRC_DIR)/%,$(DST_DIR)/%, $(SRC_IMG_FILES))

$(DST_DIR)/%.jpg: $(SRC_DIR)/%.jpg
	@mkdir -p $(dir $@)
	convert "$<" -quality 50 -resize 800x800\> "$@"

$(DST_DIR)/%.jpg: $(SRC_DIR)/%.jpeg
	@mkdir -p $(dir $@)
	convert "$<" -quality 50 -resize 800x800\> "$@"

$(DST_DIR)/%.gif: $(SRC_DIR)/%.gif
	@mkdir -p $(dir $@)
	convert "$<" -quality 50 -resize 800x800\> "$@"

$(DST_DIR)/%.png: $(SRC_DIR)/%.png
	@mkdir -p $(dir $@)
	convert "$<" -quality 50 -resize 800x800\> "$@"

.PHONY: img
img: $(DST_IMG_FILES)
ALL += $(DST_IMG_FILES)
```
## Deploy

A nice bonus is that I also deploy my website using make.

```makefile
# DEPLOY
.PHONY: site
site: $(ALL)

.PHONY: deploy
deploy: $(ALL)
	engine/sync.sh

.PHONY: clean
clean:
	-[ ! -z "$(DST_DIR)" ] && rm -rf $(DST_DIR)/*
	-[ ! -z "$(CACHE_DIR)" ] && rm -rf $(CACHE_DIR)/*
```

# Static Blog Builder

description:  Minimal and fast static website builder with make.



As someone on the Internet said not so far ago.
Building its own static building system is a rite of passage for many developers.
It has a lot of nice features.
It gives a goal with a feeling of accomplishment.
It is simple enough so most developers could build their own system.
It could also become complex when you go down the rabbit hole.

Along the years I used different tools and used and wrote of few static
website systems:


=> https://nanoc.app nanoc
 (in Ruby), at that time it looked like this:

=> https://web.archive.org/web/20081002071448/http://nanoc.stoneship.org/ old nanoc 2 website


=> https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/ hakyll
 (haskell static website generator)

=> https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-publish-html-tutorial.html org-publish
 (emacs package in conjunction with org-mode)

=> https://shakebuild.com shake
 (haskell again)

So if you look at the progression, I first used nanoc because I used ruby
and it was a new solution, the website looked really great.
Also the main developer

=> https://denisdefreyne.com Denis Defreyne
 was really helpful.
Ruby was really great at dealing with regular expressions for hacking my
documents.

Then I was interested in Haskell, and I switched to a Haskell-made
solution.
I used hakyll, and I wrote a bit about it in

=> http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Hakyll-setup/ Hakyll Setup
As a side note, the author of Hakyll

=> https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/ Jasper Van der Jeugt
 is apparently a
friend of the author of nanoc.
They both wrote a static site generators with their preferred programming
language.
I added a lot of personal features to my own site builder.
It was a nice toy project.

Then, due to a major disruption in my professional and private life I
stopped to take care of my website.

And a few years ago, I wanted to start a new website from scratch.
In the meantime I switched my editor of choice from vim to Emacs.
I started to work in Clojure and emacs is generally a natural choice
because you can configure it with LISP.
I discovered

=> https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-publish-html-tutorial.html org-mode
 (I don't think the homepage of org mode makes justice
to how incredible it is).
So org-mode comes with an export system.
Thus I switched to org-publish.
Again

=> https://her.esy.fun/posts/0001-new-blog/index.html I wrote a bit about it

It was nice but slow.
I improved a few things like writing a short script to


=> https://her.esy.fun/posts/0005-rss-gen/index.html Generate RSS from a tree of html files.

I still had the feeling it was too slow.

Static site building is a specific usage of a build system.
And as I knew I could use =pandoc= to build HTML out of org-mode files
and still versed in the Haskell culture I decided to try

=> https://shakebuild.com shake
You can learn more by reading this excellent paper about it, I
think all developer should read it:

=> https://github.com/snowleopard/build-systems/releases/download/icfp-submission/build-systems.pdf Build System à la carte

As a bonus,

=> https://pandoc.org pandoc
 is written in Haskell.
I could then directly use the

=> https://pandoc.org pandoc
 library in my build program.
It worked like a charm and it was *very fast* as compared to other
solutions I tried.
So really let me tell you shake is a great build system.

Unfortunately it was not perfect.
While it was very fast, and I was able to use pandoc API directly.
It made me dependent on Haskell.
The best way I found to have Haskell reproducible build environment is to
use

=> https://nixos.org/nix nix
This was great until the Big Sur update.
To keep it short, nix stopped working on my computers after I upgraded my
to Big Sur.
Gosh, it was painful to fix.

Concurrently I discovered

=> /posts/0016-gemini/index.html gemini
 and wanted to duplicate my website into
gemini sphere.
So I tried to update my build system but my code was to oriented to use
pandoc and it was painful to have gemini in the middle of it.
Particularly, generating a gemini index file.
My main goal was to have gemini file that could only be linked from withing
gemini sphere.
Because gemini is a lot smaller web where you could feel a bit more
protected from what the Web has become along the years.
Whatever, in the end, I just had two problems to tackles.

1. Haskell became difficult to trust as very stable tool. Stable in the
   sense that I would not have any support work to do in order to keep just
   using it and not fixing/tweaking it.
2. Simplify the overall system to have a simpler build description

So a very stable tool that I am pretty sure will still work almost exactly
as today in 10 years is *=make=* (more precisely gnumake).
I expected a lot of people had already come to the same conclusion and
wrote about it.
To my great surprise, I found very few article about generating static
website with make.
I only found solutions a bit too specific for my need.
This is why I would like to give you a more generic starting point
solution.

# The =Makefile=

Instead of copy/pasting my current =Makefile= entirely let me give you a
more generic one.
It should be a great start.

The first part will be used to simply copy the files from =src/= to
=_site/=.

```makefile
all: website

# directory containing my org files as well as my assets files
SRC_DIR ?= src
# directory where I will but the files for my website (HTML + assets)
DST_DIR ?= _site

# list all files in src
# if you want to exclude .org files use the exclude from the find command
SRC_RAW_FILES := $(shell find $(SRC_DIR) -type f)
# generate all file that should be copied in the site
# For my site, I want to publish my source files along the HTML files
DST_RAW_FILES   := $(patsubst $(SRC_DIR)/%,$(DST_DIR)/%,$(SRC_RAW_FILES))
ALL             += $(DST_RAW_FILES)

# COPY EVERYTHING (.org file included)
$(DST_DIR)/% : $(SRC_DIR)/%
	mkdir -p "$(dir $@)"
	cp "$<" "$@"
```

This part is about running the =pandoc= command for all =org= files in =src/=
so they generate a html file in =_site/=.

```makefile
# ORG -> HTML, If you prefer markdown replace .org by .md
EXT := .org
# all source file we'll pass to pandoc
SRC_PANDOC_FILES ?= $(shell find $(SRC_DIR) -type f -name "*$(EXT)")
# all destination files we expect (replace the extension by .html)
DST_PANDOC_FILES ?= $(subst $(EXT),.html, \
                        $(subst $(SRC_DIR),$(DST_DIR), \
                            $(SRC_PANDOC_FILES)))
ALL              += $(DST_PANDOC_FILES)

# use a template (you should use one)
TEMPLATE ?= templates/post.html
# URL of the CSS put yours
CSS = /css/y.css
# The pandoc command to run to generate an html out of a source file
PANDOC := pandoc \
			-c $(CSS) \
			--template=$(TEMPLATE) \
			--from org \
			--to html5 \
			--standalone

# Generate all html if the org file change or the template change
$(DST_DIR)/%.html: $(SRC_DIR)/%.org $(TEMPLATE)
	mkdir -p $(dir $@)
	$(PANDOC) $< \
		--output $@

```

A missing part is often the part where you would like to generate
an index page to list the latest posts.
Here you are a bit alone, you need to make one yourself.
There is not generic way to do this one.

```makefile
# Generating an index page is not difficult but not trivial either
HTML_INDEX := $(DST_DIR)/index.html
MKINDEX := engine/mk-index.sh
$(HTML_INDEX): $(DST_PANDOC_FILES) $(MKINDEX)
	mkdir -p $(DST_DIR)
	$(MKINDEX)
ALL += $(HTML_INDEX)
```

Finally, a few useful make commands. =make clean= and =make deploy=.

```makefile
# make deploy will deploy the files to my website write your own script
deploy: $(ALL)
	engine/deploy.sh

website: $(ALL)

.PHONY: clean

clean:
	-rm -rf $(DST_DIR)/*
```

Limitation: =make= is old.
So it really does not support spaces in filenames.
Take care of that.

Let me tell you.
While this is quite a minimalist approach (<100 lines) it is nevertheless *very fast*.
It will only generate the minimal amount of work to generate your website.
I have a nice watcher script that update the website every time I save a
file.
It is almost instantaneous.

The only risky dependencies for my website now is =pandoc=.
Perhaps, they will change how they generate an HTML from the same org file
in the future.
I still use =nix= to pin my pandoc version.
The static site builder itself is very simple, very stable and still
very efficient.

As a conclusion, if you want to write your own static site builder that's great.
There are plenty of things to learn along the way.
Still if you want something stable for a long time, with a minimal amount
of dependencies, I think this Makefile is really a great start.

description:  How I discovered gemini

This weekend I read an article about gopher and gemini.
I already seen articles about gemini pass.
Somehow, it was more appealing to me than gopher space for totally
subjective reasons I think.
Anyway this time I really dug into it, and I loved the experience.

At first sight gemini is like a parallel web for nerds.
It has fundamental changes that I would have really liked to see from the
modern web.
The client decide the design, no user tracking, calm, minimalist, simple.

Right now, on the web, most news website make the experience terrible to
read the article.
The page is bloated with a lot of animations, popin asking you to accept
the cookies, ads with videos, strange fonts or design, plenty of
javascript, trackers, etc...

Gemini make those kind of anti-design impractical.
In gemini space there is no:

* CSS: the client decide the look of the page, the fonts, the colors, the
  width of the columns, etc...
* inline image: you can still link to images, but images should not be
  displayed in the middle of the text.
* inline links: If you link to an external resource, it is clearly visible
  as an element on its own line.
* cookies
* HTTP headers used to track users
* scripts on the client side
* hard to parse format (no HTML, XHTML, etc...)

Another strength of Gemini is its protocol's simplicity.
It is easy to write your own gemini server as well as your own gemini
client within a few hours of work in your programming language of choice.

And last but not least, gemini is unfit to serve "big" files.
So we should not experience people going to gemini for music/movie piracy.
If you want to serve "big" files you should use another protocol.

Personally I started to browse gemini directly from emacs with elpher.
But I know there are a lot of clients.

I liked gemini so much I hacked my blog to also publish in the gemini sphere.
I serve my pages with a rust based server.
And I hacked a quick script to transform my org mode files to gemini format.
Gemini file format is a kind of super simplified markdown.
I really like the simplicity of it.

description:  How I use org-mode

______
In this article I'll try to give an overview of my current use of

=> https://orgmode.org org mode
I use org mode for:

* tasks management & time tracking
* writing documents (articles, book, etc...)
* note taking ; which I consider slightly different from just writing documents

TL;DR:

* =SPC y a=  ⇒ Show agenda view for today
* =SPC X=  ⇒ Capture a new task, write a description, then =C-c C-c=, save
  that in =tracker.org= (or =inbox.org= depending of the capture template)
* =SPC n o= ⇒ jump to the current time tracked tasks
* =SPC m c o= ⇒ stop the clock on that task; if you capture a new time
  tracking tasks you don't need to clock-out
* =SPC y o r=  ⇒ =org-refile=, meaning move that task somewhere else
* =SPC q= ⇒ add/remove tags to that task
______

In this article I would like to share a tool that was a real life changer
to me:

=> http://orgmode.org org mode

In my opinion emacs is worth learning just for org-mode.
This is by far the best solution I ever used to manage my tasks.
I tried a lot of differents tools before it, and this is the only one I
really stick with.
It is so versatile that it can adapt to your very specific needs.

The major difficulty faced by tasks management application is the wrong
level of complexity facing the user.
This is a very hard problem to tackle.

If your system is too simple, the users will not be able to manage the
tasks how they would like.
If your system is too complex, the user will be faced with too much
details.
So most successful systems have a way to adapt their apparent complexity to
the need of their users.
And org mode is exactly like that.
Not only starting with org mode can be extremely simple but also there are
mostly no complexity limit.

Either org mode already handle one of your need, or most of the time you
will find a package to fulfill your need.
And if not, it is easy to write your own.

Here is the result of a few years of improving my use of org mode.
Today I can say that org mode is part of my day to day life.
I still invest a bit of time to improve minor details of my workflow time
to time.
But now my daily workflow is mostly stable.
So I think I can share it.

## Overview

### daily routine

The first thing I do in the morning is to open =org-agenda= view for today.
It shows me the tasks planned for today.
What are urgent tasks, deadlines, tasks that have deadlines in a few days, etc...
I also have a glimpse of my habits, tasks that I should start at some hour
in the day, etc...

attr_org:  :width 560
caption:  Org super calendar view
name:  fig:org-super-agenda
=> ./img/org-super-agenda.png

I then start to track (/clock/) the tasks I'm currently working on.

Often during the day, I need to create new tasks.
Most of the time I create a task and I add either a deadline or a schedule
date.

Sometime I also need to deal with interruptions.
In that case, I /capture/ the interruption that will also create a new task
being clocked.

At the end of the day, every tasks I worked on are saved in a =tracker.org=
file.
That file look like a date tree.
And I generally generate a /report/ that tell me how much hours I worked
today.
Some tasks are tagged =work=.
The report filter only on the =work= tagged tasks.

Also I have some repeating tasks like review memory cards using a spaced
repetition plugin.
I start it, and it shows me a few =cards= with questions that I review.
So mainly those cards contain info I want to keep in my mind and not only
in my notes.

### document writing

Writing documents with org mode and in particular technical document is
just incredible.
Org mode feels a lot like markdown.

But org mode shine with its use of *org-babel*.
*org-babel* is used to execute code inside your document.
So you can execute block of code and get their result in block of code.
For technical writing this is extremely useful.

For example, I wrote most part of an OAuth2 provider in Clojure.
And to generate a documentation to some of our advanced users it is very
nice to provide the full HTTP request along the response.

But I also often need to play a few tricks in the doc and directly use our
Clojure code to generate JWT for example.
The great part is the ability to use those JWT generated from Clojure code
in the following code block making HTTP call.

That plus the natural ability to fold/unfold the tree structure of the org
mode file is great.

### note taking

Time to time, I need to really take the time write note on a technical
subject or sometime about articles I read about anything.
For that I use

=> https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam org roam
I only started to use it a few months ago.
But this is a great addition to my previous workflow that used =deft= (that
I still use).
But I must say, this is pretty perfect as a note taking app.

Mainly you capture notes quite easily and put links about the subject, but
also tags.
In the end that generate a graph of notes that you could use later to dig
into your own notes.
### journal

Along with note taking.
I also try to write a journal note everyday.
For that I use org-journal (another org mode related package).
I have a default template which take care of a few metrics I want to focus on.
And I guess it is different for anyone of us.

## Task Management

So here is a more detailed description about my org mode usage.

### Workflow 1; planned tasks : org-agenda + clock

1. look at the current tasks planned for today
2. select a task, clock it
3. work on the task
4. back to the task and clock it out.

I work most of my using emacs[fn:emacs-digression].
Generally the first thing I do in the morning is opening `org-calendar`.
It looks like this:

attr_org:  :width 560
caption:  Org super calendar view
name:  fig:org-super-agenda
=> ./img/org-super-agenda.png

Pretty brutalist interface which is a great thing to me.
Distraction free interface going to the essential.

With this view, I see what I planned to do today.
I also see a few "Due Soon" tasks in case I have the time to handle those.

When I start working on a task I start a clock on it (I simply type =I=
when my cursor is on the TODO line).
When I finished some task I change its status from TODO to something else.
Mainly I'm prompted when doing so:

```
{ [t] TODO   [p] IN-PROGRESS   [h] HOLD   [w] WAITING
  [d] DONE   [c] CANCELLED     [l] HANDLED }
```

And that's it.
The time spent on the task as been clocked I can work on another task.

Looking at the agenda view you could notice habits.
They start to become green when you are doing them correctly.

But generally, I don't use much direct clocking from the agenda.
Most of the time I prefer the capture mechanism.
Which bring us to "Workflow 2".

### Workflow 2: Tracking; org-capture

Most of the tasks I perform on the day are not planned.
I have a generic routine + some prepared events and tasks to performs.
But during the day you have multiple interruptions, and part of my job is
to write code reviews too.
I cannot plan those.

In that case I use =org-capture= along =org-refile=.
Mainly =org-capture= helps you create a new TODO entry.
And =org-refile= will help you move that TODO entry to the correct place.

So let say I get a direct message in the chat asking me to do something.
I generally start org capture (for me it's =SPC X=).
I am presented with the following choice:

```
Select a capture template
=========================

[t] todo
[c] chat
[e] email
[m] meeting
[p] pause
[r] review
[w] work
[i] interruption
[f] chore
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
[q] Abort
```

In my example it was a chat interruption.
So I type =i= that presents me with this

```
  **** IN-PROGRESS |  :interruption:
  [2020-09-23 Wed 08:01]
  ref :: [link-to-where-I-was-in-emacs-when-captured]
```

My cursor placed where the =|= is displayed.
Here I add the tag =chat= and a small description, "dm from John about X" for example.
Then I type =C-c C-c= and the TODO is placed in a =tracker.org= file under
a date tree that looks like this:

```org-mode
  * 2020
  ** 2020-W39
  *** 2020-09-21 Monday
  *** 2020-09-22 Tuesday
  *** 2020-09-23 Wednesday
  **** IN-PROGRESS Chat with John about X                          :interruption:chat:
  [2020-09-23 Wed 17:58]
  ref ::
  ...
```

So the clock for this task started at the moment at made the capture.
In my workflow, I prefer to finish the capture and stop clock later.
So after I finished the capture, the clock is still running while the task
is put in my tracker file.

Once I finished with that task.
I can:

1. Jump to the tasks with =SPC n o= (=org-clock-goto=), and stop the
   clock =SPC m c o= (=clock-out=).
2. Jump to the task and change its status to =DONE= which will stop the clock.
3. Capture another tasks which will stop the clock on the current task and
   will start on the new one.

By the end of the day, my tracker file will contain a date tree with all
the tasks I done in the day.
All tasks nicely clocked.
I generally create a clock report that look like this:

```
  #+BEGIN: clocktable :scope subtree :maxlevel 4 :timestamp t :narrow 36! :match "work"
  #+CAPTION: Clock summary at [2020-09-23 Wed 08:20]
  | Timestamp              | Headline                             | Time   |   |      |      |

```

And that's mostly it for TODOs and tasks handling.

### Workflow 3: Add new tasks; org-capture / org-refile
Another thing I do quite often.
I need to add new task to be done.
Be it for today or another day.

In that case, I generally use org-capture again.
This time I choose =t= for TODO and I generally detail the task to be done.
I add either a SCHEDULE (when I plan to start) or a DEADLINE (when this
must be finished) and I refile it.

So refile will start a fuzzy search to put this task under some subtree.
So instead of going to my =tracker.org= file, this goes to my =inbox.org=
file.

And it will appear in my agenda.

### Configuration

So to have all of that, I added a lot of configuration over time.
But here is the most important part.

Most of that config is what I personally think are better defaults.
And a minor part of it only is about how I organize myself.

```emacs-lisp
(defun org-mode-config ()
  "Org-mode."
  (setq org-extend-today-until 4
        org-use-effective-time t)
  (setq org-todo-keywords
        '((sequence "TODO(t)"
                    "IN-PROGRESS(p)"
                    "|"
                    "DONE(d)"
                    "HOLD(h@/!)"
                    "CANCELED(c@/!)"
                    "HANDLED(l@/!)")
          (sequence "|" "PAUSE(p)" "CHAT(c)" "EMAIL(e)" "MEETING(m)" "REVIEW(r)" "GEEK(g)")))

  ;;; Look & Feel

  ;; I like to have something different than ellipsis because I often use them
  ;; myself.
  (setq org-ellipsis " [+]")
  (custom-set-faces '(org-ellipsis ((t (:foreground "gray40" :underline nil)))))

  (defun my-org-settings ()
    (org-display-inline-images)
    (setq fill-column 75)
    (abbrev-mode)
    (org-indent-mode)
    nil)

  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'my-org-settings)

  (setq org-tags-column 69)

  ;; src block indentation / editing / syntax highlighting
  (setq org-src-fontify-natively t
        org-src-window-setup 'current-window ;; edit in current window
        org-src-preserve-indentation t ;; do not put two spaces on the left
        org-src-tab-acts-natively t)

  ;; *** Templates
  ;; the %a refer to the place you are in emacs when you make the capture
  ;; that's very neat when you do that in an email for example.
  (setq org-capture-templates
        '(("t" "todo"         entry (file "~/.org/inbox.org")
           "* TODO %?\n%U\n- ref :: %a\n")
          ;; time tracker (clocked tasks)
          ("g" "geek"         entry (file+olp+datetree "~/.org/tracker.org")
           "* GEEK %?         :perso:\n%U\n- ref :: %a\n"
           :prepend t :tree-type week :clock-in t :clock-keep t)
          ("c" "chat"         entry (file+olp+datetree "~/.org/tracker.org")
           "* CHAT %?         :work:chat:\n%U\n- ref :: %a\n"
           :prepend t :tree-type week :clock-in t :clock-keep t)
          ("e" "email"        entry (file+olp+datetree "~/.org/tracker.org")
           "* EMAIL %?        :work:email:\n%U\n- ref :: %a\n"

## Conclusions

That article is already quite long.
But if you intend to dig into org mode, this can be a nice default starting point.

I haven't really dig into some details but only given you the ability to
start not completely from scratch and with decent default values for an
already advanced usage.

To resume:

* =SPC y a=  ⇒ Show agenda view for today
* =SPC X=  ⇒ Capture a new task, write a description, then =C-c C-c=, save
  that in =tracker.org= (or =inbox.org= depending of the capture template)
* =SPC n o= ⇒ jump to the current time tracked tasks
* =SPC m c o= ⇒ stop the clock on that task; if you capture a new time
  tracking tasks you don't need to clock-out
* =SPC y o r=  ⇒ =org-refile=, meaning move that task somewhere else
* =SPC q= ⇒ add/remove tags to that task

## Footnotes


[fn:emacs-digression]
/Short digression/:
Historically, I coded using different IDEs.
Then I worked for a company that forced me to use terrible keyboards and
after just a few weeks I started to have serious wrist issues.
So to minimize that pain I switched to vim.
And it was /awesome/.
Once you're use to the power of vim keybinding forever your soul will bound
to them.
So learning vim is a bit like learning a new music instrument.
You need to construct some muscle memory and integrate one after one new
tricks.
Once learned your personal editing power start to become overwhelming.

After a few years of vim, I wanted to try to explore new editor tooling.
So I switched to emacs using the spacemacs distribution.
So mainly it's vim but with even better keybindgs, helpers and within
emacs.
The main reason for the switch was that vimscript is a really bad language
to configure your editor.
Emacs use emacs-LISP.
For editor customization a LISP looked perfect to me.
LISP is still one of the most powerful and easy to use programming language
to date.

And recently, as my personal configuration started to grow so much I
switched to

=> https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs doom-emacs
I was quite hesitant to do the switch but so far its been a pleasure.
IMHO using

=> https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs doom-emacs
 is a lot better than using my own personal
configuration from scratch because I wouldn't be able to end up with so
much configuration quality.

# Auto change emacs theme

description:  A small snippet to automatically change theme in emacs.

One thing I kind of like is the ability to change emacs theme depending of
the hour.
There are two possibilities.
One would be to sync with the sun using the current location.
There is an emacs package for that.
It's called

=> https://github.com/hadronzoo/theme-changer theme-changer
 which at the time of writing those lines is
asking for a new maintainer.
This theme changer is very elegant because like macOS use the location to
determine if it is day or night.
But I wanted to have more themes from morning to night:

1. early morning: deep yellow (gruvbox-light),
2. morning: light yellow (solarized-light),
3. day: grey/blueish during the day (nord-light),
4. evening: deep yellow again (gruvbox-light)
5. night: dark theme (oceanic-next)
6. sleep time: neon-like (laserwave)

And also, I wanted that to follow my working hours and not really the sun.
I might change my mind and use the code of theme-changer to follow the
curve of the sun.
But for now, just using straight hours should be good enough.
So here is my piece of code I added to my doom-emacs =config.el=:

```emacs-lisp
(defun y/auto-update-theme ()
  "depending on time use different theme"
  ;; very early => gruvbox-light, solarized-light, nord-light
  (let* ((hour (nth 2 (decode-time (current-time))))
         (theme (cond ((<= 7 hour 8)   'doom-gruvbox-light)
                      ((= 9 hour)      'doom-solarized-light)
                      ((<= 10 hour 16) 'doom-nord-light)
                      ((<= 17 hour 18) 'doom-gruvbox-light)
                      ((<= 19 hour 22) 'doom-oceanic-next)
                      (t               'doom-laserwave))))
    (when (not (equal doom-theme theme))
      (setq doom-theme theme)
      (load-theme doom-theme t))
    ;; run that function again next hour
    (run-at-time (format "%02d:%02d" (+ hour 1) 0) nil 'y/auto-update-theme)))

(y/auto-update-theme)
```

I'm still playing with it.
So there still might be a bug.
Use at your own risk.
Happy hacking to all of you.
