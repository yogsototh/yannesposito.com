description:  Minimal and fast static website builder with make.



As someone on the Internet said not so far ago.
Building its own static building system is a rite of passage for many developers.
It has a lot of nice features.
It gives a goal with a feeling of accomplishment.
It is simple enough so most developers could build their own system.
But it could also become very complex when you go down the rabbit hole.

Along the years I used different tools and used and wrote of few static
website systems:


=> https://nanoc.app nanoc
 (in Ruby), at that time it looked like this:

=> https://web.archive.org/web/20081002071448/http://nanoc.stoneship.org/ old nanoc 2 website


=> https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/ hakyll
 (haskell static website generator)

=> https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-publish-html-tutorial.html org-publish
 (emacs package in conjunction with org-mode)

=> https://shakebuild.com shake
 (haskell again)

So if you look at the progression, I first used nanoc because I used ruby
and it was a very new solution, the website looked really great.
Also the main developer

=> https://denisdefreyne.com Denis Defreyne
 was really helpful.
Ruby was really great at dealing with regular expressions for hacking my
documents.

Then I was interested in Haskell, and I switched to a Haskell-made
solution.
I used hakyll, and I wrote a bit about it in

=> http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Hakyll-setup/ Hakyll Setup
As a side note, the author of Hakyll

=> https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/ Jasper Van der Jeugt
 is apparently a
friend of the author of nanoc.
They both wrote a static site generators with their preferred programming
language.
I added a lot of personal features to my own site builder.
It was a nice toy project.

Then, due to a major disruption in my professional and private life I
stopped to take care of my website.

And a few years ago, I wanted to start a new website from scratch.
In the meantime I switched my editor of choice from vim to Emacs.
I started to work in Clojure and emacs is generally a natural choice
because you can configure it with LISP.
I discovered

=> https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-publish-html-tutorial.html org-mode
 (I don't think the homepage of org mode makes justice
to how incredible it is).
So org-mode comes with an export system.
Thus I switched to org-publish.
Again

=> https://her.esy.fun/posts/0001-new-blog/index.html I wrote a bit about it

It was nice, but very slow.
I improved a few things like writing a short script to


=> https://her.esy.fun/posts/0005-rss-gen/index.html Generate RSS from a tree of html files.

But I still had the feeling it was too slow.

Static site building is a specific usage of a build system.
And as I knew I could use =pandoc= to build HTML out of org-mode files
and still versed in the Haskell culture I decided to try

=> https://shakebuild.com shake
You can learn more by reading this excellent paper about it, I
think all developer should read it:

=> https://github.com/snowleopard/build-systems/releases/download/icfp-submission/build-systems.pdf Build System Ã  la carte

As a bonus,

=> https://pandoc.org pandoc
 is written in Haskell.
I could then directly use the

=> https://pandoc.org pandoc
 library in my build program.
It worked like a charm and it was *very fast* as compared to other
solutions I tried.
So really let me tell you shake is a great build system.

But it was not perfect.
While it was very fast, and I was able to use pandoc API directly.
It made me dependent on Haskell.
The best way I found to have Haskell reproducible build environment is to
use

=> https://nixos.org/nix nix
This was great until the Big Sur update.
To keep it short, nix stopped working on my computers after I upgraded my
to Big Sur.
Gosh, it was painful to fix.

Concurrently I discovered

=> /posts/0016-gemini/index.html gemini
 and wanted to duplicate my website into
gemini sphere.
So I tried to update my build system but my code was to oriented to use
pandoc and it was painful to have gemini in the middle of it.
Particularly, generating a gemini index file.
My main goal was to have gemini file that could only be linked from withing
gemini sphere.
Because gemini is a lot smaller web where you could feel a bit more
protected from what the Web has become along the years.
Whatever, in the end, I just had two problems to tackles.

1. Haskell became difficult to trust as very stable tool. Stable in the
   sense that I would not have any support work to do in order to keep just
   using it and not fixing/tweaking it.
2. Simplify the overall system to have a simpler build description

So a very stable tool that I am pretty sure will still work almost exactly
as today in 10 years is *=make=* (more precisely gnumake).
I expected a lot of people had already come to the same conclusion and
wrote about it.
To my great surprise, I found very few article about generating static
website with make.
I only found solutions a bit too specific for my need.
This is why I would like to give you a more generic starting point
solution.

# The =Makefile=

Instead of copy/pasting my current =Makefile= entirely let me give you a
more generic one.
It should be a great start.

The first part will be used to simply copy the files from =src/= to
=_site/=.

```makefile
all: website

# directory containing my org files as well as my assets files
SRC_DIR ?= src
# directory where I will but the files for my website (HTML + assets)
DST_DIR ?= _site

# list all files in src
# if you want to exclude .org files use the exclude from the find command
SRC_RAW_FILES := $(shell find $(SRC_DIR) -type f)
# generate all file that should be copied in the site
# For my site, I want to publish my source files along the HTML files
DST_RAW_FILES   := $(patsubst $(SRC_DIR)/%,$(DST_DIR)/%,$(SRC_RAW_FILES))
ALL             += $(DST_RAW_FILES)

# COPY EVERYTHING (.org file included)
$(DST_DIR)/% : $(SRC_DIR)/%
	mkdir -p "$(dir $@)"
	cp "$<" "$@"
```

This part is about running the =pandoc= command for all =org= files in =src/=
so they generate a html file in =_site/=.

```makefile
# ORG -> HTML, If you prefer markdown replace .org by .md
EXT := .org
# all source file we'll pass to pandoc
SRC_PANDOC_FILES ?= $(shell find $(SRC_DIR) -type f -name "*$(EXT)")
# all destination files we expect (replace the extension by .html)
DST_PANDOC_FILES ?= $(subst $(EXT),.html, \
                        $(subst $(SRC_DIR),$(DST_DIR), \
                            $(SRC_PANDOC_FILES)))
ALL              += $(DST_PANDOC_FILES)

# use a template (you should use one)
TEMPLATE ?= templates/post.html
# URL of the CSS put yours
CSS = /css/y.css
# The pandoc command to run to generate an html out of a source file
PANDOC := pandoc \
			-c $(CSS) \
			--template=$(TEMPLATE) \
			--from org \
			--to html5 \
			--standalone

# Generate all html if the org file change or the template change
$(DST_DIR)/%.html: $(SRC_DIR)/%.org $(TEMPLATE)
	mkdir -p $(dir $@)
	$(PANDOC) $< \
		--output $@

```

A missing part is often the part where you would like to generate
an index page to list the latest posts.
Here you are a bit alone, you need to make one yourself.
There is not generic way to do this one.

```makefile
# Generating an index page is not difficult but not trivial either
HTML_INDEX := $(DST_DIR)/index.html
MKINDEX := engine/mk-index.sh
$(HTML_INDEX): $(DST_PANDOC_FILES) $(MKINDEX)
	mkdir -p $(DST_DIR)
	$(MKINDEX)
ALL += $(HTML_INDEX)
```

Finally, a few useful make commands. =make clean= and =make deploy=.

```makefile
# make deploy will deploy the files to my website write your own script
deploy: $(ALL)
	engine/deploy.sh

website: $(ALL)

.PHONY: clean

clean:
	-rm -rf $(DST_DIR)/*
```

Limitation: =make= is old.
So it really does not support spaces in filenames.
Take care of that.

But let me tell you.
While this is quite a minimalist approach (<100 lines) it is nevertheless *very fast*.
It will only generate the minimal amount of work to generate your website.
I have a nice watcher script that update the website every time I save a
file.
It is almost instantaneous.

The only risky dependencies for my website now is =pandoc=.
Perhaps, they will change how they generate an HTML from the same org file
in the future.
I still use =nix= to pin my pandoc version.
But the static site builder itself is very simple, very stable and still
very efficient.

As a conclusion, if you want to write your own static site builder that's great.
There are plenty of things to learn along the way.
Still if you want something stable for a long time, with a minimal amount
of dependencies, I think this Makefile is really a great start.

description:  How I discovered gemini

This weekend I read an article about gopher and gemini.
I already seen articles about gemini pass.
Somehow, it was more appealing to me than gopher space for totally
subjective reasons I think.
Anyway this time I really dug into it, and I loved the experience.

At first sight gemini is like a parallel web for nerds.
It has fundamental changes that I would have really liked to see from the
modern web.
The client decide the design, no user tracking, calm, minimalist, simple.

Right now, on the web, most news website make the experience terrible to
read the article.
The page is bloated with a lot of animations, popin asking you to accept
the cookies, ads with videos, strange fonts or design, plenty of
javascript, trackers, etc...

Gemini make those kind of anti-design impractical.
In gemini space there is no:

* CSS: the client decide the look of the page, the fonts, the colors, the
  width of the columns, etc...
* inline image: you can still link to images, but images should not be
  displayed in the middle of the text.
* inline links: If you link to an external resource, it is clearly visible
  as an element on its own line.
* cookies
* HTTP headers used to track users
* scripts on the client side
* hard to parse format (no HTML, XHTML, etc...)

Another strength of Gemini is its protocol's simplicity.
It is easy to write your own gemini server as well as your own gemini
client within a few hours of work in your programming language of choice.

And last but not least, gemini is unfit to serve "big" files.
So we should not experience people going to gemini for music/movie piracy.
If you want to serve "big" files you should use another protocol.

Personally I started to browse gemini directly from emacs with elpher.
But I know there are a lot of clients.

I liked gemini so much I hacked my blog to also publish in the gemini sphere.
I serve my pages with a rust based server.
And I hacked a quick script to transform my org mode files to gemini format.
Gemini file format is a kind of super simplified markdown.
I really like the simplicity of it.

description:  How I use org-mode

______
In this article I'll try to give an overview of my current use of

=> https://orgmode.org org mode
I use org mode for:

* tasks management & time tracking
* writing documents (articles, book, etc...)
* note taking ; which I consider slightly different from just writing documents

TL;DR:

* =SPC y a=  â Show agenda view for today
* =SPC X=  â Capture a new task, write a description, then =C-c C-c=, save
  that in =tracker.org= (or =inbox.org= depending of the capture template)
* =SPC n o= â jump to the current time tracked tasks
* =SPC m c o= â stop the clock on that task; if you capture a new time
  tracking tasks you don't need to clock-out
* =SPC y o r=  â =org-refile=, meaning move that task somewhere else
* =SPC q= â add/remove tags to that task
______

In this article I would like to share a tool that was a real life changer
to me:

=> http://orgmode.org org mode

In my opinion emacs is worth learning just for org-mode.
This is by far the best solution I ever used to manage my tasks.
I tried a lot of differents tools before it, and this is the only one I
really stick with.
It is so versatile that it can adapt to your very specific needs.

The major difficulty faced by tasks management application is the wrong
level of complexity facing the user.
This is a very hard problem to tackle.

If your system is too simple, the users will not be able to manage the
tasks how they would like.
If your system is too complex, the user will be faced with too much
details.
So most successful systems have a way to adapt their apparent complexity to
the need of their users.
And org mode is exactly like that.
Not only starting with org mode can be extremely simple but also there are
mostly no complexity limit.

Either org mode already handle one of your need, or most of the time you
will find a package to fulfill your need.
And if not, it is easy to write your own.

Here is the result of a few years of improving my use of org mode.
Today I can say that org mode is part of my day to day life.
I still invest a bit of time to improve minor details of my workflow time
to time.
But now my daily workflow is mostly stable.
So I think I can share it.

## Overview

### daily routine

The first thing I do in the morning is to open =org-agenda= view for today.
It shows me the tasks planned for today.
What are urgent tasks, deadlines, tasks that have deadlines in a few days, etc...
I also have a glimpse of my habits, tasks that I should start at some hour
in the day, etc...

attr_org:  :width 560
caption:  Org super calendar view
name:  fig:org-super-agenda
=> ./img/org-super-agenda.png

I then start to track (/clock/) the tasks I'm currently working on.

Often during the day, I need to create new tasks.
Most of the time I create a task and I add either a deadline or a schedule
date.

Sometime I also need to deal with interruptions.
In that case, I /capture/ the interruption that will also create a new task
being clocked.

At the end of the day, every tasks I worked on are saved in a =tracker.org=
file.
That file look like a date tree.
And I generally generate a /report/ that tell me how much hours I worked
today.
Some tasks are tagged =work=.
The report filter only on the =work= tagged tasks.

Also I have some repeating tasks like review memory cards using a spaced
repetition plugin.
I start it, and it shows me a few =cards= with questions that I review.
So mainly those cards contain info I want to keep in my mind and not only
in my notes.

### document writing

Writing documents with org mode and in particular technical document is
just incredible.
Org mode feels a lot like markdown.

But org mode shine with its use of *org-babel*.
*org-babel* is used to execute code inside your document.
So you can execute block of code and get their result in block of code.
For technical writing this is extremely useful.

For example, I wrote most part of an OAuth2 provider in Clojure.
And to generate a documentation to some of our advanced users it is very
nice to provide the full HTTP request along the response.

But I also often need to play a few tricks in the doc and directly use our
Clojure code to generate JWT for example.
The great part is the ability to use those JWT generated from Clojure code
in the following code block making HTTP call.

That plus the natural ability to fold/unfold the tree structure of the org
mode file is great.

### note taking

Time to time, I need to really take the time write note on a technical
subject or sometime about articles I read about anything.
For that I use

=> https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam org roam
I only started to use it a few months ago.
But this is a great addition to my previous workflow that used =deft= (that
I still use).
But I must say, this is pretty perfect as a note taking app.

Mainly you capture notes quite easily and put links about the subject, but
also tags.
In the end that generate a graph of notes that you could use later to dig
into your own notes.
### journal

Along with note taking.
I also try to write a journal note everyday.
For that I use org-journal (another org mode related package).
I have a default template which take care of a few metrics I want to focus on.
And I guess it is different for anyone of us.

## Task Management

So here is a more detailed description about my org mode usage.

### Workflow 1; planned tasks : org-agenda + clock

1. look at the current tasks planned for today
2. select a task, clock it
3. work on the task
4. back to the task and clock it out.

I work most of my using emacs[fn:emacs-digression].
Generally the first thing I do in the morning is opening `org-calendar`.
It looks like this:

attr_org:  :width 560
caption:  Org super calendar view
name:  fig:org-super-agenda
=> ./img/org-super-agenda.png

Pretty brutalist interface which is a great thing to me.
Distraction free interface going to the essential.

With this view, I see what I planned to do today.
I also see a few "Due Soon" tasks in case I have the time to handle those.

When I start working on a task I start a clock on it (I simply type =I=
when my cursor is on the TODO line).
When I finished some task I change its status from TODO to something else.
Mainly I'm prompted when doing so:

```
{ [t] TODO   [p] IN-PROGRESS   [h] HOLD   [w] WAITING
  [d] DONE   [c] CANCELLED     [l] HANDLED }
```

And that's it.
The time spent on the task as been clocked I can work on another task.

Looking at the agenda view you could notice habits.
They start to become green when you are doing them correctly.

But generally, I don't use much direct clocking from the agenda.
Most of the time I prefer the capture mechanism.
Which bring us to "Workflow 2".

### Workflow 2: Tracking; org-capture

Most of the tasks I perform on the day are not planned.
I have a generic routine + some prepared events and tasks to performs.
But during the day you have multiple interruptions, and part of my job is
to write code reviews too.
I cannot plan those.

In that case I use =org-capture= along =org-refile=.
Mainly =org-capture= helps you create a new TODO entry.
And =org-refile= will help you move that TODO entry to the correct place.

So let say I get a direct message in the chat asking me to do something.
I generally start org capture (for me it's =SPC X=).
I am presented with the following choice:

```
Select a capture template
=========================

[t] todo
[c] chat
[e] email
[m] meeting
[p] pause
[r] review
[w] work
[i] interruption
[f] chore
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
[q] Abort
```

In my example it was a chat interruption.
So I type =i= that presents me with this

```
  **** IN-PROGRESS |  :interruption:
  [2020-09-23 Wed 08:01]
  ref :: [link-to-where-I-was-in-emacs-when-captured]
```

My cursor placed where the =|= is displayed.
Here I add the tag =chat= and a small description, "dm from John about X" for example.
Then I type =C-c C-c= and the TODO is placed in a =tracker.org= file under
a date tree that looks like this:

```org-mode
  * 2020
  ** 2020-W39
  *** 2020-09-21 Monday
  *** 2020-09-22 Tuesday
  *** 2020-09-23 Wednesday
  **** IN-PROGRESS Chat with John about X                          :interruption:chat:
  [2020-09-23 Wed 17:58]
  ref ::
  ...
```

So the clock for this task started at the moment at made the capture.
In my workflow, I prefer to finish the capture and stop clock later.
So after I finished the capture, the clock is still running while the task
is put in my tracker file.

Once I finished with that task.
I can:

1. Jump to the tasks with =SPC n o= (=org-clock-goto=), and stop the
   clock =SPC m c o= (=clock-out=).
2. Jump to the task and change its status to =DONE= which will stop the clock.
3. Capture another tasks which will stop the clock on the current task and
   will start on the new one.

By the end of the day, my tracker file will contain a date tree with all
the tasks I done in the day.
All tasks nicely clocked.
I generally create a clock report that look like this:

```
  #+BEGIN: clocktable :scope subtree :maxlevel 4 :timestamp t :narrow 36! :match "work"
  #+CAPTION: Clock summary at [2020-09-23 Wed 08:20]

```

And that's mostly it for TODOs and tasks handling.

### Workflow 3: Add new tasks; org-capture / org-refile
Another thing I do quite often.
I need to add new task to be done.
Be it for today or another day.

In that case, I generally use org-capture again.
This time I choose =t= for TODO and I generally detail the task to be done.
I add either a SCHEDULE (when I plan to start) or a DEADLINE (when this
must be finished) and I refile it.

So refile will start a fuzzy search to put this task under some subtree.
So instead of going to my =tracker.org= file, this goes to my =inbox.org=
file.

And it will appear in my agenda.

### Configuration

So to have all of that, I added a lot of configuration over time.
But here is the most important part.

Most of that config is what I personally think are better defaults.
And a minor part of it only is about how I organize myself.

```emacs-lisp
(defun org-mode-config ()
  "Org-mode."
  (setq org-extend-today-until 4
        org-use-effective-time t)
  (setq org-todo-keywords
        '((sequence "TODO(t)"
                    "IN-PROGRESS(p)"
                    "|"
                    "DONE(d)"
                    "HOLD(h@/!)"
                    "CANCELED(c@/!)"
                    "HANDLED(l@/!)")
          (sequence "|" "PAUSE(p)" "CHAT(c)" "EMAIL(e)" "MEETING(m)" "REVIEW(r)" "GEEK(g)")))

  ;;; Look & Feel

  ;; I like to have something different than ellipsis because I often use them
  ;; myself.
  (setq org-ellipsis " [+]")
  (custom-set-faces '(org-ellipsis ((t (:foreground "gray40" :underline nil)))))

  (defun my-org-settings ()
    (org-display-inline-images)
    (setq fill-column 75)
    (abbrev-mode)
    (org-indent-mode)
    nil)

  (org-super-agenda-mode t))
```

## Conclusions

That article is already quite long.
But if you intend to dig into org mode, this can be a nice default starting point.

I haven't really dig into some details but only given you the ability to
start not completely from scratch and with decent default values for an
already advanced usage.

To resume:

* =SPC y a=  â Show agenda view for today
* =SPC X=  â Capture a new task, write a description, then =C-c C-c=, save
  that in =tracker.org= (or =inbox.org= depending of the capture template)
* =SPC n o= â jump to the current time tracked tasks
* =SPC m c o= â stop the clock on that task; if you capture a new time
  tracking tasks you don't need to clock-out
* =SPC y o r=  â =org-refile=, meaning move that task somewhere else
* =SPC q= â add/remove tags to that task

## Footnotes


[fn:emacs-digression]
/Short digression/:
Historically, I coded using different IDEs.
Then I worked for a company that forced me to use terrible keyboards and
after just a few weeks I started to have serious wrist issues.
So to minimize that pain I switched to vim.
And it was /awesome/.
Once you're use to the power of vim keybinding forever your soul will bound
to them.
So learning vim is a bit like learning a new music instrument.
You need to construct some muscle memory and integrate one after one new
tricks.
Once learned your personal editing power start to become overwhelming.

After a few years of vim, I wanted to try to explore new editor tooling.
So I switched to emacs using the spacemacs distribution.
So mainly it's vim but with even better keybindgs, helpers and within
emacs.
The main reason for the switch was that vimscript is a really bad language
to configure your editor.
Emacs use emacs-LISP.
For editor customization a LISP looked perfect to me.
LISP is still one of the most powerful and easy to use programming language
to date.

And recently, as my personal configuration started to grow so much I
switched to

=> https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs doom-emacs
I was quite hesitant to do the switch but so far its been a pleasure.
IMHO using

=> https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs doom-emacs
 is a lot better than using my own personal
configuration from scratch because I wouldn't be able to end up with so
much configuration quality.

# Auto change emacs theme

keywords:  emacs
description:  A small snippet to automatically change theme in emacs.

One thing I kind of like is the ability to change emacs theme depending of
the hour.
There are two possibilities.
One would be to sync with the sun using the current location.
There is an emacs package for that.
It's called

=> https://github.com/hadronzoo/theme-changer theme-changer
 which at the time of writing those lines is
asking for a new maintainer.
This theme changer is very elegant because like macOS use the location to
determine if it is day or night.
But I wanted to have more themes from morning to night:

1. early morning: deep yellow (gruvbox-light),
2. morning: light yellow (solarized-light),
3. day: grey/blueish during the day (nord-light),
4. evening: deep yellow again (gruvbox-light)
5. night: dark theme (oceanic-next)
6. sleep time: neon-like (laserwave)

And also, I wanted that to follow my working hours and not really the sun.
I might change my mind and use the code of theme-changer to follow the
curve of the sun.
But for now, just using straight hours should be good enough.
So here is my piece of code I added to my doom-emacs =config.el=:

```emacs-lisp
(defun y/auto-update-theme ()
  "depending on time use different theme"
  ;; very early => gruvbox-light, solarized-light, nord-light
  (let* ((hour (nth 2 (decode-time (current-time))))
         (theme (cond ((<= 7 hour 8)   'doom-gruvbox-light)
                      ((= 9 hour)      'doom-solarized-light)
                      ((<= 10 hour 16) 'doom-nord-light)
                      ((<= 17 hour 18) 'doom-gruvbox-light)
                      ((<= 19 hour 22) 'doom-oceanic-next)
                      (t               'doom-laserwave))))
    (when (not (equal doom-theme theme))
      (setq doom-theme theme)
      (load-theme doom-theme t))
    ;; run that function again next hour
    (run-at-time (format "%02d:%02d" (+ hour 1) 0) nil 'y/auto-update-theme)))

(y/auto-update-theme)
```

I'm still playing with it.
So there still might be a bug.
Use at your own risk.
Happy hacking to all of you.

This week I didn't take a look at HN to grab some news.
And this week-end, in the morning I read those:


=> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23102430 Zoom acquires keybase

attr_html:  :alt Midsommar Welcome
name:  Welcome to Halsingland
caption:  Welcome to Halsingland
=> Welcome-to-Halsingland.jpg

Similar articles have existed for years on different products.
What is their common point?
/Software tooling and their potential change and disappearance/.

Across the years, too many times I saw tools disappear.
By tools I mean applications, web applications, web sites.
I think we can also include programming languages, control versioning
tools, building tools, package manager, etc...

The story can be quite different.
Sometimes the disappearance of a tool is positive, because I found a better
one (from cvs to svn to git).
But, too often, the tool simply disappears or worse downgrade its quality.
I think we can find different names for those softwares:

* /bloatware/: remember digg, stumbleupon, windows?
* /downgradeware/: Swagger-UI v3 (v2 is neat), reddit new redesign (looks better, but slow)
* /payware/: Useful free service ask for money now. Or cost a lot more.
* /crapware/: Stop to works, quality degrate unless you pay: Twitter streaming API?
* /dieware/: Remember Friendfeed, Google Readerâ¢, etc...
* etc...

This is often quite frustrating because you lose a lot of your investment
with that tool.

Regarding Github Codespace; the integration of VSCodeâ¢ inside GitHubâ¢ can
be even worse.
This is what I would call a /trapware/.

______
/trapware/:
A software that is intended to put you inside a closed ecosystem.
By slowly but surely add features that while looking great for the user at
first sight will prevent interoperability with other tools.
______

Furthermore, the fact that Microsoft is involved give this story a taste of


=> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish Embrace, Extend and Extinguish

My real concern is that it could become a /work framework/.
This could impose the full tooling on a lot of developers without giving
them the freedom of choice.

For a startup CTO/CEO this GitHubâ¢ Codespaceâ¢ could offer the following
advantages:

* /security/: impossible or very hard to steal the source code by a single dev.
* /homogeneity/: all dev must use the same development environment. Thus
  the integration of new dev is faster.
* /cheaper/: don't need to pay for a full featured, fast machine to each new developer.
  A less performant machine able to display an electron app will do the trick.
* /stats/: you can observe the throughput of your developers.
  How many commits a day, how many lines of code, etc...
  How much bugs involved which part of the code and thus which dev to blame?
  How much time the dev is typing, moving its mouse, how much copy/paste is
  involved, etc...

For the single developers and open source developers this offer:

* /homogeneity/: if I learn how to work in this environment, I'll be easier
  to recruit and I'll know how to work fast.
* /lower barrier to entry/: for an opensource repository, it will become much
  easier for anyone to propose a PR to fix some issue. No need to local
  clone the project, no need to download all the dependencies to test it
  locally, etc...

But the price to pay is hidden.

1. First, you are now, not able to choose your local working environment on
   your machine.
2. GitHubâ¢ can still change so much to become one of the previously
   mentionned ~/.*ware/~ you don't want to be involved with.
   They could forces you to pay a lot more, remove features, redesign to a
   bloatware, make it harder to interop with other platforms (prefer Azure
   to AWS etc...).
3. If everything involve machines in the cloud via the browser and via
   authorized plugins only. A lot of tools, features will never be allowed
   in this new ecosystem.
4. Surveillance on meaningless or wrong metrics about your work.
   Instead of being evaluated on the feature you shipped or on other higher
   level metrics. It will be very tempting for your bosses to find flaws in
   your working habits.
   We are already living in a world were surveillance, metrics and stats
   are too easy to grab about a person. And anyone involved know this is
   all bullshit.
   Human are very good to play those kind of games.
   So people really working hard for the best will certainly perform badly
   compared to other people that simply trick the system.

So as good as Codespace can be, I think this warning is good to keep that in mind.
Don't put yourself in a trap.

The

=> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23102430 Zoom acquires keybase
 is just another story of a dying product.
Apparently the keybase team will probably stop maintaining keybase.
The idea behind keybase was pretty nice.
And they filled a gap in the current open source world.

The last article I mentionned was

=> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23107123 Making Emacs popular again
The first comment in HN was about how VSCode is easy to start with as
compared to Emacs that need a lot more time to configure correctly for your
needs.
Yes, VSCode certainly just work and is easy to use.
But Emacs is another beast.
VSCode can become bad very fast, you don't control how it will evolve.
The fact that this is a succesful Microsoft product does not garanty it
will keep its currently quality.
Emacs on the other hand is 44 year old and was designed so that it adapts
to you.
You are the one using libs and customizing it.

The argument to chose VSCode instead of Emacs look similar to me to the
debate "Frameworks vs Libraries".
Frameworks are easier to start with, but soon you find corner cases were
you start to fight against them.

A Library on the other hand, is just a bunch of helpers you can use.
And if you need another functionality, just make it using the libraries.
But you have a lot more work to do yourself.

The common pattern I see during choice decision is often reducible to:

1. Easy now, but less extensible and harder in the long run.
2. Harder now, but more extensible and easier in the long run.

As a conclustion I would state that when you need to choose between
different tools.
Take the time to think about the investment costs.
Sometime, the bit of pain in the begining is worth it.
In particular if you are going to use this tool every days for many hours
during the following years.
If on the other hand you don't plan to use that tool much.
Going with the easy option is certainly the best choice.

I consider Emacs to be of the 2nd option when compared to VSCode.
Harder to start, but with a lot more control and potential power that you
will probably never be able to get with most modern IDE/Editor.
Also choosing a Free Software[fn:1] gives you a lot more control about its
future.

[fn:1] note I said /free software/ and not /open source/; c.f

## Post-conclusion -- Emacs is awesome

To go beyond my opinion, I'd like to share my experience with editors and
emacs.

When I started to be serious about coding, I was taught to use vi, not vim,
vi.
I only knew a few survival vi commands: =i=, =a=, =dd= and =cw=.
A few years later I started to use IDEs and I was thrilled.
A few years forward I started to work for a company that forced me to use
their shitty computers.
Quite soon, I started to have wrist issues.
Thus I decided to use vim again but be serious about it this time.
And I saw the benefits only after a few weeks.
They were tremendous.
No more wrist pain.
And an incredible edition power at the tip of my fingers[fn:vim].

Then, I started a new job where we decided to code in Clojure.
Of course Clojure being a LISP and emacs using also a LISP as script
language, it sound natural to try Emacs even though I loved Vim.
I started by installing spacemacs.
At that time I didn't want to invest much time in learning Emacs.
I just wanted to learn the tricks that will make Emacs more valuable to my
work.
It did after just a few days or maybe weeks.
I used Emacs superficially for years.
This was already quite efficient, at least as much as vim.

Recently I dug deeper.
I heard much praise about org-mode and I became curious.
I discovered why it is so great.
Basic org-mode is already quite valuable.
But if you dig, it starts to be awesome.
Unfortunately this is a bit hard to describe how org-mode is great
without really digging a bit.

You can think of org-mode as an extremely versatile todo-list and note
taker with agenda and time tracking integration.
You are in deep control of your workflow.
But mainly here are a few example of usages that are really worth it:

* note taker
* documentation; this is a far better than markdown
* interactive document; run code inside the doc, keep track of the results
* export to HMTL/PDF
* time tracking
* reminders

Recently there is also org-roam that is a step further to make orgmode a
nice place to keep track of all your knowledge in one place.
You can take a look at this

=> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg61ocfxk3c great video
 by Matt Williams.

Emacs changed my workflow by making me more productive.
It improved not only my coding workflow, but my full work environment.
I started with the editor, a few plugins, and slowly, I integrated more
aspect of my day to day tasks in emacs.
Emacs is designed to adapt to your own needs.
As such it is a lot easier to automate a lot of small tasks.

I really love Emacs and if you want to joyfully join the Emacs users here
are my advices:

Start by using either

=> https://www.spacemacs.org spacemacs
 or

=> https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs doom-emacs
It will take a few weeks to absorb vim keybindings.
Slowly you'll start to learn how to configure it for your needs.

I really advise you to take a look at org-mode.
Mastering it could change your carrier.
Im my opinion

=> https://orgmode.org org-mode
 alone is a good reason enough to use emacs.
But there are a lot more to discover.

However, if you are used to tools from startups, with nice UI/UX.
Almost no configuration cost.
Be aware that digging in Free Softwares is a lot different.
Instead of having a big bundle with everything prepared to work you you
will need to take the time to configure each part of a big system
separately.

Howevery I'm deeply convinced the investment is really worth it.

description:  A generalization of solarized.
description:  I tried to keep the same fundamentals and to free some variables.

After many years using

=> https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/ Solarized
 I changed to a new one.
I use it for my terminal, emacs and most of my tools.

This is inspired by both

=> https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/ Solarized
 and

=> https://nordtheme.com Nord
I switched because I wanted a greyer theme.

Ethan Shoovnover the creator of Solarized gave plenty of information about
the creation of his colorscheme.
And I stumbled upon the

=> https://nordtheme.com Nord
 theme.
And I really liked it.
But while the colors are great, it is not as easy to switch from light to
dark theme than with solarized because Solarized has a lot of nice
properties.

So I kept the main principle used to create Solarized but freed a few parameters.
The tint of the dark and light colors for the background and the text, as
well as the contrast of the colors.

And I created this minimal application in Purescript:

https://solaryzed.esy.fun

It is still not perfect, because the real theme I use for my website as a
slightly bigger contrast for text.

Here is the CSS you could use:


______html
<style>#colors div {
  display: inline-block;
  height: 50.0px;
  width: 50.0px;
  margin: 2px 0;
  font-weight: bold;
  line-height: 50.0px;
  text-align: center; }
  #colors { padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0; }

description:  Add links to code block during orgmode export.

I wanted to add a link to the file I export with org tangle.
And it was surprisingly difficult to find.
Apparently I am one of the few people that use orgmode the way I do.

Using orgmode file as markdown to blog.
And exporting to a different file some code block.
So I often endup writing something like:

```org
..begin_src elisp :tangle foo.el
```

I tangle the source code that export the code block to an external file.
Then I use this hook during HTML export to add a caption with the link the
file I tangled:

```elisp :tangle org_html_export_show_tangle.el
(defun my-add-link-to-tangled-files (backend)
  "Add a link just before source code block with tangled files.
BACKEND is the export backend. Used as symbol."
  (while ;; (re-search-forward )
      (re-search-forward "^\\( *\\)#\\+begin_src .*:tangle \\([^\s\n]*\\)" nil t)
    (replace-match "\\1#+CAPTION:

=> ./\\2 =\\2=
\n\\&")))

(add-hook 'org-export-before-processing-hook
          'my-add-link-to-tangled-files)
```

And this article is an example of the result.
The link with the listing is generated automatically for me.

A small note regarding CSS.
My =pre= have a =margin-top=.
But I wanted to get rid of it when the previous block was a =label=.
This is achievable with:

```css
label + pre {margin-top: 0;}
```

That's it.
It took me really a long time to just think about using caption, and not
trying something smarter like injecting html code, etc...
So I hope it could help someone.

# Learn Haskell Now!
subtitle:  A dense Haskell learning material for the brave
date:  [2019-12-15 Sun]
author:  Yann Esposito
email:  yann@esposito.host
=> /files/publickey.txt gpg
keywords:  Haskell programming functional tutorial
description:  A short and intense introduction to Haskell. This is an update of my old (2012) article. A lot of things have changed since then. Mostly I changed my approach about the easiest way to install a Haskell playground. I removed the not as important part, and added a short introduction about starting a new project.

______
*Prelude*

In 2012, I really believed that every developer should learn Haskell.
This is why I wrote my old article.
This is the end of 2019 and I still strongly believe that.
I think you should at least be able to understand enough Haskell to write a
simple tool.
There are some features in Haskell that I really miss in most programming
languages and that would not appear to be difficult to provide.
Typically sum types.
A concept so simple yet so helpful.

Since I wrote my article the Haskell ecosystem has evolved:

1. Project building has different existing solutions.
   When I wrote this article I made some web applications that I can no
   longer build today.
   I mean, if I really want to invest some time, I'm sure I could upgrade those
   projects to build again.
   But this is not worth the hassle.
   Now we have =stack=, =nix=, =cabal new-build= and I'm sure other
   solutions.
2. GHC is able to do a lot more magic.
   This is beyond the scope of an introduction material in my opinion.
   While the learning curve is as steep as before, the highest point of
   learning just climbed higher and higher with each successive new GHC release.
3. Still no real consencus about how to work, learn, and use Haskell.
   In my opinion there are three different perspectives on Haskell that
   could definitively change how you make decisions about different aspect
   of Haskell programming.
   I believe the main groups of ideolgies are application developers, library
   developers and the main compiler (GHC) developers.
   I find those tensions a proof of a healthy environment.
   There are different solutions to the same problems and that is perfectly
   fine.
   This is different when you compare to other language ecosystems where
   decisions are more controlled or enforced.
   I feel fine with both approaches.
   But you must understand that there is no central mindset within
   Haskellers
   unlike I can find in some other programming language communities.
4. I think that Haskell is now perceived as a lot more serious programming
   language now.
   A lot more big projects uses Haskell.
   Haskell proved its utility to write succesful complex entreprise
   projects.

While the ecosystem evolved I believe that I myself have certainly matured.
Since 2013 I'm paid to develop in Clojure.
I write most of my personal side projects in Haskell or in some
Haskell-inspired language.

As such I can follow two functional programming communities growth and
evolution.
I am kind of confident that my Haskell understanding is a lot better than
before.
But I still think, the ability to learn new Haskell subject is infinite.

Someday I would like to write a post about my current team philosophy about
programming.
Our main rule is to use as few features of a programming language as
possible to achieve our goal.
This is a kind of merge between minimalism and pragmatism that in the end
provide a tremendous amount of benefits.
This is why, even if I like to play with the latest Haskell trendy
features, I generally program without those.
With just a very few amount of Haskell features you will already be in
enviromnent with a *lot* of benefits as compared to many programming
languages.

So enough talk, here is my updated article.
I added a section about how to create a new project template with nix.

I will try to write other articles about how to write a real program in
Haskell.
I tried to add those to this already long article, but, it occurs to be
more work than expected.
So I preferred stop at this point for now and provide separate articles in
the future related to Haskell application development.
______

# Introduction

I really believe that every developer should learn Haskell.
I don't think every dev needs to be a super Haskell ninja, but they should
at least discover what Haskell has to offer.
Learning Haskell opens your mind.

Mainstream languages share the same foundations:

* variables
* loops
* pointers[fn:1]
* data structures, objects and classes (for most)

Haskell is very different.
The language uses a lot of concepts I had never heard about before.
Many of those concepts will help you become a better programmer.

But learning Haskell can be (and will certainly be) hard.
It was for me.
In this article I try to provide as much help as possible to accelerate
your learning.

This article will certainly be hard to follow.
This is on purpose.
There is no shortcut to learning Haskell.
It is hard and challenging.
But I believe this is a good thing.
It is because it is hard that Haskell is interesting and rewarding.

Today, I could not really provide a conventional path to learn Haskell.
So I think the best I can do is point you to the

=> https://www.haskell.org/documentation/ haskell.org
 documentation
website.
And you will see that most path involve a long learning process.
By that, I mean that you should read a long book and invest a lot of hours
and certainly days before having a good idea about what Haskell is all about.

In contrast, this article is a brief and dense overview of all
major aspects of Haskell.
I also added some information I lacked while I learned Haskell.

The article contains five parts:

* *Essential Haskell*: Haskell syntax, and some essential notions.
* *First Dive*:

  - Functional style; a progressive example, from imperative to
    functional style
  - Types; types and a standard binary tree example
  - Infinite Structure; manipulate an infinite binary tree!

* *Dive into the impure*:

  - Deal with IO; A minimal example
  - IO trick explained; the hidden detail I lacked to understand IO
  - Monads; incredible how we can generalize

* *Start swimming*: Start a new project.

## Install

caption:  Haskell logo
=> ./Haskell-logo.png

If you are not using either Linux nor macOS, you should look here:
https://www.haskell.org/downloads/.
Otherwise, you can follow my advice to use nix:

1. Install

=> https://nixos.org/nix nix
 (The version I used while writting this article was
   nix (Nix) 2.3.1, future 2.X.X versions should work with the 
   examples in this article)
3. create a new empty directory =hsenv= somewhere
4. Put the following =shell.nix= file inside it

   ```nix :tangle shell.nix
   { nixpkgs ? import (fetchTarball https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/19.09.tar.gz) {} }:
   let
     inherit (nixpkgs) pkgs;
     inherit (pkgs) haskellPackages;


     haskellDeps = ps: with ps; [
       base
       protolude
       containers
     ];


     ghc = haskellPackages.ghcWithPackages haskellDeps;


     nixPackages = [
       ghc
       pkgs.gdb
       haskellPackages.cabal-install
     ];
   in
   pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation {
     name = "env";
     buildInputs = nixPackages;
     shellHook = ''
        export PS1="\n\[[hs:\033[1;32m\]\W\[\033[0m\]]> "
     '';
   }
   ```

5. In the =hsenv= directory, in a terminal, run =nix-shell --pure=.
   You should wait a lot of time for everything to download.
   And you should be ready.
   You will have in your PATH:
   - =ghc=, the Haskell compiler
   - =ghci= that we can described as a Haskell REPL
   - =runghc= that will be able to interpret a Haskell file
   - =cabal= which is the main tool to deal with Haskell projects
   - the Haskell libraries =protolude= and =containers=.
6. To test your env, rung =ghci= and type =import Protolude= you should see
   something like this:

   ```
   ~/hsenv> nix-shell
   [nix-shell:~/hsenv]$ ghci
   GHCi, version 8.6.5: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
   Prelude> import Protolude
   Prelude Protolude>
   ```

Congratulations you should be ready to start now.

______
* There are multiple ways to install Haskell and I don't think there is a
  full consensus between developer about what is the best method.
  If you whish to use another method take a look at

=> http://haskell.org haskell.org
* This install method is only suitable for using as a playground and I
  think perfectly adapted to run code example from this article.
  I do not recommend it for serious development.
* =nix= is a generic package manager and goes beyond Haskell.
  One great good point is that it does not only manage Haskell packages but
  really a lot of other kind of packages.
  This can be helpful if you need to depends on a Haskell package that
  itself depends on a system library, for example =ncurses=.
* I use

=> http://nixos.org/nix =nix=
 for other projects unrelated to Haskell.
  For example, I use the nix-shell bang pattern for shell script for which
  I can assume the executable I want are present.
______

______
*BONUS*: use

=> https://direnv.net =direnv=


```
~ cd hsenv
~ echo "use nix" > .envrc
~ direnv allow
```

Now each time you'll cd into your hsenv directory you'll get the
environment set for you.
______

## Don't be afraid

caption:  The Scream
=> ./munch_TheScream.jpg

Many books/articles about Haskell start by introducing some esoteric
formula (quick sort, Fibonacci, etc...).
I will do the exact opposite.
At first I won't show you any Haskell super power.
I will start with similarities between Haskell and other programming
languages.
Let's jump to the mandatory "Hello World".

```haskell :tangle hello.hs
main = putStrLn "Hello World!"
```

______
~ runghc hello.hs
Hello World!
______

Now, a program asking your name and replying "Hello" using the name you
entered:

```haskell :tangle name.hs
main = do
    print "What is your name?"
    name <- getLine
    print ("Hello " ++ name ++ "!")
```

First, let us compare this with similar programs in a few imperative
languages:

```python
# Python
print "What is your name?"
name = raw_input()
print "Hello %s!" % name
```

```ruby
# Ruby
puts "What is your name?"
name = gets.chomp
puts "Hello #{name}!"
```

```C
// In C
#include <stdio.h>
int main (int argc, char **argv) {
    char name[666]; // <- An Evil Number!
    // What if my name is more than 665 character long?
    printf("What is your name?\n");
    scanf("%s", name);
    printf("Hello %s!\n", name);
    return 0;
}
```

The structure is the same, but there are some syntax differences.
The main part of this tutorial will be dedicated to explaining why.

In Haskell there is a =main= function and every object has a type.
The type of =main= is =IO ()=.
This means =main= will cause side effects.

Just remember that Haskell can look a lot like mainstream imperative
languages.

## Very basic Haskell

caption:  Picasso minimal owl
=> ./picasso_owl.jpg

Before continuing you need to be warned about some essential properties
of Haskell.

/Functional/

Haskell is a functional language.
If you have an imperative language background, you'll have to learn a lot
of new things.
Hopefully many of these new concepts will help you to program even in
imperative languages.

/Advanced Static Typing/

Instead of being in your way like in =C=, =C++= or =Java=, the type system
is here to help you.

/Purity/

Generally your functions won't modify anything in the outside world.
This means they can't modify the value of a variable, can't get user input,
can't write on the screen, can't launch a missile.
On the other hand, parallelism will be very easy to achieve.
Haskell makes it clear where effects occur and where your code is pure.
Also, it will be far easier to reason about your program.
Most bugs will be prevented in the pure parts of your program.

Furthermore, pure functions follow a fundamental law in Haskell:

______
Applying a function with the same parameters always returns the same value.
______

/Laziness/

Laziness by default is an uncommon language design.
By default, Haskell evaluates something only when it is needed.
In consequence, it provides an elegant way to manipulate infinite
structures, for example.

A last warning about how you should read Haskell code.
For me, it is like reading scientific papers.
Some parts are clear, but when you see a formula, just focus and read
slower.
Also, while learning Haskell, it /really/ doesn't matter much if you don't
understand syntax details.
If you meet a =>>==, =<$>=, =<-= or any other weird symbol, just ignore
them and follows the flow of the code.

### Function declaration

You might be used to declaring functions like this:

In =C=:

```C
int f(int x, int y) {
    return x*x + y*y;
}
```

In JavaScript:

```javascript
function f(x,y) {
    return x*x + y*y;
}
```

in Python:

```python
def f(x,y):
    return x*x + y*y
```

in Ruby:

```ruby
def f(x,y)
    x*x + y*y
end
```

In Scheme:

```scheme
(define (f x y)
    (+ (* x x) (* y y)))
```

Finally, the Haskell way is:

```haskell
f x y = x*x + y*y
```

Very clean. No parenthesis, no =def=.

Don't forget, Haskell uses functions and types a lot.
It is thus very easy to define them.
The syntax was particularly well thought out for these objects.

### A Type Example

Although it is not mandatory, type information for functions is usually
made explicit.
It's not mandatory because the compiler is smart enough to infer it for
you.
It's a good idea because it indicates intent and understanding.

Let's play a little.
We declare the type using =::=

```haskell :tangle basic.hs
f :: Int -> Int -> Int
f x y = x*x + y*y

main = print (f 2 3)
```

______
[nix-shell:~/hsenv]$ runghc basic.hs
13
______

Now try

```haskell :tangle error_basic.hs
f :: Int -> Int -> Int
f x y = x*x + y*y

main = print (f 2.3 4.2)
```

You should get this error:

______
[nix-shell:~/hsenv]$ runghc error_basic.hs

The problem: =4.2= isn't an Int.

The solution: don't declare a type for =f= for the moment and let Haskell
infer the most general type for us:

```haskell :tangle float_basic.hs
f x y = x*x + y*y

main = print (f 2.3 4.2)
```

It works!
Luckily, we don't have to declare a new function for every single type.
For example, in =C=, you'll have to declare a function for =int=, for
=float=, for =long=, for =double=, etc...

But, what type should we declare?
To discover the type Haskell has found for us, just launch ghci:

Prelude> let f x y = x*x + y*y
Prelude> :type f
f :: Num a => a -> a -> a
______

Uh? What is this strange type?

```haskell
Num a => a -> a -> a
```

First, let's focus on the right part =a -> a -> a=.
To understand it, just look at a list of progressive examples:

| TheÂ writtenÂ type   | Its meaning                                                               |
|--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =Int=              | the type =Int=                                                            |
| =Int -> Int=       | the type function from =Int= to =Int=                                     |
| =Float -> Int=     | the type function from =Float= to =Int=                                   |
| =a -> Int=         | the type function from any type to =Int=                                  |
| =a -> a=           | the type function from any type =a= to the same type =a=                  |
| =a -> a -> a=      | the type function of two arguments of any type =a= to the same type =a=   |

In the type =a -> a -> a=, the letter =a= is a /type variable/.
It means =f= is a function with two arguments and both arguments and the
result have the same type.
The type variable =a= could take many different type values.
For example =Int=, =Integer=, =Float=...

So instead of having a forced type like in =C= and having to declare a
function for =int=, =long=, =float=, =double=, etc., we declare only one
function like in a dynamically typed language.

This is sometimes called parametric polymorphism.
It's also called having your cake and eating it too.

Generally =a= can be any type, for example a =String= or an =Int=, but also
more complex types, like =Trees=, other functions, etc...
But here our type is prefixed with =Num a =>=.

=Num= is a /type class/.
A type class can be understood as a set of types.
=Num= contains only types which behave like numbers.
More precisely, =Num= is class containing types which implement a specific
list of functions, and in particular =(+)= and =(*)=.

Type classes are a very powerful language construct.
We can do some incredibly powerful stuff with this.
More on this later.

Finally, =Num a => a -> a -> a= means:

Let =a= be a type belonging to the =Num= type class.
This is a function from type =a= to (=a -> a=).

Yes, strange.
In fact, in Haskell no function really has two arguments.
Instead all functions have only one argument.
But we will note that taking two arguments is equivalent to taking one
argument and returning a function taking the second argument as a
parameter.

More precisely =f 3 4= is equivalent to =(f 3) 4=.
Note =f 3= is a function:

```haskell
f :: Num a => a -> a -> a

g :: Num a => a -> a
g = f 3

g y â 3*3 + y*y
```

Another notation exists for functions.
The lambda notation allows us to create functions without assigning them a
name.
We call them anonymous functions.
We could also have written:

```haskell
  g = \y -> 3*3 + y*y
```

The =\= is used because it looks like =Î»= and is ASCII.

If you are not used to functional programming your brain should be starting
to heat up.
It is time to make a real application.

But just before that, we should verify the type system works as
expected:

```haskell :tangle typed_float_basic.hs
f :: Num a => a -> a -> a
f x y = x*x + y*y

main = print (f 3 2.4)
```

It works, because, =3= is a valid representation both for Fractional
numbers like Float and for Integer.
As =2.4= is a Fractional number, =3= is then interpreted as being also a
Fractional number.

If we force our function to work with different types, it will fail:

```haskell
f :: Num a => a -> a -> a
f x y = x*x + y*y

x :: Int
x = 3
y :: Float
y = 2.4
-- won't work because type x â  type y
main = print (f x y)
```

The compiler complains.
The two parameters must have the same type.

If you believe that this is a bad idea, and that the compiler should make
the transformation from one type to another for you, you should really
watch this great (and funny) video:

# Essential Haskell

=> ./kandinsky_gugg.jpg

I suggest that you skim this part.
Think of it as a reference.
Haskell has a lot of features.
A lot of information is missing here.
Come back here if the notation feels strange.

I use the =â= symbol to state that two expression are equivalent.
It is a meta notation, =â= does not exists in Haskell.
I will also use =â= to show what the return value of an expression is.

## Notations

**** Arithmetic

```
3 + 2 * 6 / 3 â 3 + ((2*6)/3)
```

**** Logic

```
True || False â True
True && False â False
True == False â False
True /= False â True  (/=) is the operator for different
```

**** Powers

```
x^n     for n an integral (understand Int or Integer)
x**y    for y any kind of number (Float for example)
```

=Integer= has no limit except the capacity of your machine:

Yeah! And also rational numbers FTW! But you need to import the module
=Data.Ratio=:

Prelude> :m Data.Ratio
Data.Ratio> (11 % 15) * (5 % 3)
11 % 9

**** Lists

______
[]                      â empty list
[1,2,3]                 â List of integral

**** Strings

In Haskell strings are list of =Char=.

______

"a" :: [Char]
""  â []
"ab" â ['a','b'] â  'a':"b" â 'a':['b'] â 'a':'b':[]
"abc" â "ab"++"c"
______

______
/Remark/: In real code you shouldn't use list of char to represent text.
You should mostly use =Data.Text= instead.
If you want to represent a stream of ASCII char, you should use
=Data.ByteString=.
______

**** Tuples

The type of couple is =(a,b)=.
Elements in a tuple can have different types.

______
-- All these tuples are valid
(2,"foo")
(3,'a',[2,3])
((2,"a"),"c",3)

fst (x,y)       â  x
snd (x,y)       â  y

snd (x,y,z)     â  ERROR: snd :: (a,b) -> b
______

**** Deal with parentheses

To remove some parentheses you can use two functions: =($)= and =(.)=.

______
-- By default:
f g h x         â  (((f g) h) x)

-- the $ replace parenthesis from the $
-- to the end of the expression
f g $ h x       â  f g (h x) â (f g) (h x)
f $ g h x       â  f (g h x) â f ((g h) x)
f $ g $ h x     â  f (g (h x))

-- (.) the composition function
(f . g) x       â  f (g x)
(f . g . h) x   â  f (g (h x))
______

## Useful notations for functions

Just a reminder:

______
x :: Int            â x is of type Int
x :: a              â x can be of any type
x :: Num a => a     â x can be any type a
                      such that a belongs to Num type class
f :: a -> b         â f is a function from a to b
f :: a -> b -> c    â f is a function from a to (bâc)
f :: (a -> b) -> c  â f is a function from (aâb) to c
______

Remember that defining the type of a function before its declaration isn't
mandatory.
Haskell infers the most general type for you.
But it is considered a good practice to do so.

/Infix notation/

```haskell :tangle functions.hs
square :: Num a => a -> a
square x = x^2
```

Note =^= uses infix notation.
For each infix operator there its associated prefix notation.
You just have to put it inside parenthesis.

```haskell :tangle functions.hs
square' x = (^) x 2

square'' x = (^2) x
```

We can remove =x= in the left and right side!
It's called Î·-reduction.

```haskell :tangle functions.hs
square''' = (^2)
```

Note we can declare functions with ='= in their name.
Here:

______
=square= â =square'= â =square''= â =square'''=
______

Note for each prefix notation you can transform it to infix notation with
=`= like this:

______
foo x y â x `foo` y
______

/Tests/

An implementation of the absolute function.

```haskell :tangle functions.hs
absolute :: (Ord a, Num a) => a -> a
absolute x = if x >= 0 then x else -x
```

Note: the =if .. then .. else= Haskell notation is more like the =Â¤?Â¤:Â¤=
C operator.
You cannot forget the =else=.

Another equivalent version:

```haskell :tangle functions.hs
absolute' x
    | x >= 0 = x
    | otherwise = -x
```

______
Notation warning: indentation is /important/ in Haskell.
Like in Python, bad indentation can break your code!
______

```haskell :tangle functions.hs
main = do
      print $ square 10
      print $ square' 10
      print $ square'' 10
      print $ square''' 10
      print $ absolute 10
      print $ absolute (-10)
      print $ absolute' 10
      print $ absolute' (-10)
```

# First dive

In this part, you will be introduced to functional style, types and
infinite structures manipulation.

## Functional style

caption:  Biomechanical Landscape by H.R. Giger
=> ./hr_giger_biomechanicallandscape_500.jpg

In this section, I will give a short example of the impressive refactoring
ability provided by Haskell.
We will select a problem and solve it in a standard imperative way.
Then I will make the code evolve.
The end result will be both more elegant and easier to adapt.

Let's solve the following problem:

______
Given a list of integers, return the sum of the even numbers in the list.

example: =[1,2,3,4,5] â  2 + 4 â  6=
______

To show differences between functional and imperative approaches, I'll
start by providing an imperative solution (in javascript):

```javascript
function evenSum(list) {
    var result = 0;
    for (var i=0; i< list.length ; i++) {
        if (list[i] % 2 ==0) {
            result += list[i];
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

In Haskell, by contrast, we don't have variables or a for loop.
One solution to achieve the same result without loops is to use recursion.

______
/Remark/: Recursion is generally perceived as slow in imperative languages.
But this is generally not the case in functional programming.
Most of the time Haskell will handle recursive functions efficiently.
______

Here is a =C= version of the recursive function.
Note that for simplicity I assume the int list ends with the first =0=
value.

```C
int evenSum(int *list) {
    return accumSum(0,list);
}

int accumSum(int n, int *list) {
    int x;
    int *xs;
    if (*list == 0) { // if the list is empty
        return n;
    } else {
        x = list[0]; // let x be the first element of the list
        xs = list+1; // let xs be the list without x
        if ( 0 == (x%2) ) { // if x is even
            return accumSum(n+x, xs);
        } else {
            return accumSum(n, xs);
        }
    }
}
```

Keep this code in mind.
We will translate it into Haskell.
First, however, I need to introduce three simple but useful functions we
will use:

```haskell
even :: Integral a => a -> Bool
head :: [a] -> a
tail :: [a] -> [a]
```

=even= verifies if a number is even.

```haskell
even :: Integral a => a -> Bool
even 3  â False
even 2  â True
```

=head= returns the first element of a list:

```haskell
head :: [a] -> a
head [1,2,3] â 1
head []      â ERROR
```

=tail= returns all elements of a list, except the first:

```haskell
tail :: [a] -> [a]
tail [1,2,3] â [2,3]
tail [3]     â []
tail []      â ERROR
```

Note that for any non empty list =l=, =l â (head l):(tail l)=

The first Haskell solution.
The function =evenSum= returns the sum of all even numbers in a list:

```haskell :tangle evenSum_v1.hs
-- Version 1
evenSum :: [Integer] -> Integer
evenSum l = accumSum 0 l
accumSum n l = if l == []
                  then n
                  else let x = head l
                           xs = tail l
                       in if even x
                              then accumSum (n+x) xs
                              else accumSum n xs
```

To test a function you can use =ghci=:

______
~/t/hsenv> ghci
GHCi, version 8.6.5: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help

Here is an example of execution[fn:2]:

______

2 is even
accumSum (0+2+4) [5]
5 is odd
accumSum (0+2+4) []
l == []
0+2+4
0+6

______

Coming from an imperative language all should seem right.
In fact, many things can be improved here.
First, we can generalize the type.

```haskell
evenSum :: Integral a => [a] -> a
```

Next, we can use sub functions using =where= or =let=.
This way our =accumSum= function will not pollute the namespace of our
module.

```haskell :tangle evenSum_v2.hs
-- Version 2
evenSum :: Integral a => [a] -> a
evenSum l = accumSum 0 l
    where accumSum n l =
            if l == []
                then n
                else let x = head l
                         xs = tail l
                     in if even x
                            then accumSum (n+x) xs
                            else accumSum n xs
```

Next, we can use pattern matching.

```haskell :tangle evenSum_v3.hs
-- Version 3
evenSum l = accumSum 0 l
    where
        accumSum n [] = n
        accumSum n (x:xs) =
             if even x
                then accumSum (n+x) xs
                else accumSum n xs
```

What is pattern matching?
Use values instead of general parameter names[fn:3].

Instead of saying: =foo l = if l == [] then <x> else <y>= you simply state:

```haskell
foo [] =  <x>
foo l  =  <y>
```

But pattern matching goes even further.
It is also able to inspect the inner data of a complex value.
We can replace

```haskell
foo l =  let x  = head l
             xs = tail l
         in if even x
             then foo (n+x) xs
             else foo n xs
```

with

```haskell
foo (x:xs) = if even x
                 then foo (n+x) xs
                 else foo n xs
```

This is a very useful feature.
It makes our code both terser and easier to read.

In Haskell you can simplify function definitions by Î·-reducing them.
For example, instead of writing:

```haskell
f x = (some expresion) x
```

you can simply write

```haskell
f = (some expression)
```

We use this method to remove the =l=:

```haskell :tangle evenSum_v4.hs
-- Version 4
evenSum :: Integral a => [a] -> a
evenSum = accumSum 0
    where
        accumSum n [] = n
        accumSum n (x:xs) =
             if even x
                then accumSum (n+x) xs
                else accumSum n xs
```

### Higher Order Functions

caption:  Escher
=> ./escher_polygon.png

To make things even better we should use higher order functions.
What are these beasts?
Higher order functions are functions taking functions as parameters.

Here are some examples:

```haskell
filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
foldl :: (a -> b -> a) -> a -> [b] -> a
```

Let's proceed by small steps.

```haskell :tangle evenSum_v5.hs
-- Version 5
evenSum l = mysum 0 (filter even l)
    where
      mysum n [] = n
      mysum n (x:xs) = mysum (n+x) xs
```

where

```haskell
filter even [1..10] â  [2,4,6,8,10]
```

The function =filter= takes a function of type (=a -> Bool=) and a list of
type =[a]=.
It returns a list containing only elements for which the function returned
=True=.

Our next step is to use another technique to accomplish the same thing as a
loop.
We will use the =foldl= function to accumulate a value as we pass through
the list.
The function =foldl= captures a general coding pattern:

```haskell
myfunc list = foo initialValue list
foo accumulated []     = accumulated
foo tmpValue    (x:xs) = foo (bar tmpValue x) xs
```

Which can be replaced by:

```haskell
myfunc list = foldl bar initialValue list
```

If you really want to know how the magic works, here is the definition of
=foldl=:

```haskell
foldl f z [] = z
foldl f z (x:xs) = foldl f (f z x) xs
```

```haskell
foldl f z [x1,...xn]
â  f (... (f (f z x1) x2) ...) xn
```

But as Haskell is lazy, it doesn't evaluate =(f z x)= and simply pushes it
onto the stack.
This is why we generally use =foldl'= instead of =foldl=; =foldl'= is a
/strict/ version of =foldl=.
If you don't understand what lazy and strict means, don't worry, just
follow the code as if =foldl= and =foldl'= were identical.

Now our new version of =evenSum= becomes:

```haskell :tangle evenSum_v6.hs
-- Version 6
-- foldl' isn't accessible by default
-- we need to import it from the module Data.List
import Data.List
evenSum l = foldl' mysum 0 (filter even l)
  where mysum acc value = acc + value
```

We can also simplify this by using directly a lambda notation.
This way we don't have to create the temporary name =mysum=.

```haskell :tangle evenSum_v7.hs
-- Version 7
-- Generally it is considered a good practice
-- to import only the necessary function(s)
import Data.List (foldl')
evenSum l = foldl' (\x y -> x+y) 0 (filter even l)
```

And of course, we note that

```haskell
(\x y -> x+y) â (+)
```

Finally

```haskell :tangle evenSum_v8.hs
-- Version 8
import Data.List (foldl')
evenSum :: Integral a => [a] -> a
evenSum l = foldl' (+) 0 (filter even l)
```

=foldl'= isn't the easiest function to grasp.
If you are not used to it, you should study it a bit.

To help you understand what's going on here, let's look at a step by step
evaluation:

```haskell
  evenSum [1,2,3,4]
â foldl' (+) 0 (filter even [1,2,3,4])
â foldl' (+) 0 [2,4]
â foldl' (+) (0+2) [4]
â foldl' (+) 2 [4]
â foldl' (+) (2+4) []
â foldl' (+) 6 []
â 6
```

Another useful higher order function is =(.)=.
The =(.)= function corresponds to mathematical composition.

```haskell
(f . g . h) x â  f ( g (h x))
```

We can take advantage of this operator to Î·-reduce our function:

```haskell :tangle evenSum_v9.hs
-- Version 9
import Data.List (foldl')
evenSum :: Integral a => [a] -> a
evenSum = (foldl' (+) 0) . (filter even)
```

Also, we could rename some parts to make it clearer:

```haskell :tangle evenSum_v10.hs
-- Version 10
import Data.List (foldl')
sum' :: (Num a) => [a] -> a
sum' = foldl' (+) 0
evenSum :: Integral a => [a] -> a
evenSum = sum' . (filter even)
```

It is time to discuss the direction our code has moved as we introduced
more functional idioms.
What did we gain by using higher order functions?

At first, you might think the main difference is terseness.
But in fact, it has more to do with better thinking.
Suppose we want to modify our function slightly, for example, to get the
sum of all even squares of elements of the list.

______
[1,2,3,4] â· [1,4,9,16] â· [4,16] â· 20
______

Updating version 10 is extremely easy:

```haskell
squareEvenSum = sum' . (filter even) . (map (^2))
squareEvenSum' = evenSum . (map (^2))
```

We just had to add another "transformation function".

______
map (^2) [1,2,3,4] â [1,4,9,16]
______

The =map= function simply applies a function to all the elements of a list.

We didn't have to modify anything /inside/ the function definition.
This makes the code more modular.
But in addition you can think more mathematically about your functions.
You can also use your functions interchangeably with others, as needed.
That is, you can /compose/, map, fold, filter using your new function.

Modifying version 1 is left as an exercise to the reader âº.

If you believe we have reached the end of generalization, then know you are
very wrong.
For example, there is a way to not only use this function on lists but on
any recursive type.
If you want to know how, I suggest you to read this quite fun article:
[[http://eprints.eemcs.utwente.nl/7281/01/db-utwente-40501F46.pdf][Functional Programming with Bananas, Lenses, Envelopes and Barbed Wire by
Meijer, Fokkinga and Paterson]].

This example should show you how great pure functional programming is.
Unfortunately, using pure functional programming isn't well suited to all
usages.
Or at least such a language hasn't been found yet.

One of the great powers of Haskell is the ability to create DSL (Domain
Specific Language) making it easy to change the programming paradigm.

In fact, Haskell is also great when you want to write imperative style
programming.
Understanding this was really hard for me to grasp when first learning
Haskell.
A lot of effort tends to go into explaining the superiority of the
functional approach.
Then when you start using an imperative style with Haskell, it can be hard
to understand when and how to use it.

But before talking about this Haskell super-power, we must talk about
another essential aspect of Haskell: /Types/.

## Types

______
{{{tldr}}}

  - =type Name = AnotherType= is just an alias and the compiler doesn't
    mark any difference between =Name= and =AnotherType=.
  - =data Name = NameConstructor AnotherType= does mark a difference.
  - =data= can construct structures which can be recursives.
  - =deriving= is magic and creates functions for you.
______

In Haskell, types are strong and static.

Why is this important?
It will help you /greatly/ to avoid mistakes.
In Haskell, most bugs are caught during the compilation of your program.
And the main reason is because of the type checking during compilation.
Type checking makes it easy to detect where you used the wrong parameter
at the wrong place, for example.

### Type inference

Static typing is generally essential for fast execution.
But most statically typed languages are bad at generalizing concepts.
Haskell's saving grace is that it can /infer/ types.

Here is a simple example, the =square= function in Haskell:

```haskell
square x = x * x
```

This function can =square= any Numeral type.
You can provide =square= with an =Int=, an =Integer=, a =Float= a
=Fractional= and even =Complex=.
Proof by example:

______
~/t/hsenv> ghci
GHCi, version 8.6.5: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
Prelude> let square x = x * x
Prelude> square 2
4
Prelude> square 2.1
4.41
Prelude> :m Data.Complex
Prelude Data.Complex> square (2 :+ 1)
3.0 :+ 4.0
______

=x :+ y= is the notation for the complex (x + iy).

Now compare with the amount of code necessary in C:

```C
int     int_square(int x) { return x*x; }
float   float_square(float x) {return x*x; }
complex complex_square (complex z) {
    complex tmp;
    tmp.real = z.real * z.real - z.img * z.img;
    tmp.img = 2 * z.img * z.real;
}
complex x,y;
y = complex_square(x);
```

For each type, you need to write a new function.
The only way to work around this problem is to use some meta-programming
trick, for example using the pre-processor.
In C++ there is a better way, C++ templates:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <complex>
using namespace std;

template<typename T>
T square(T x)
{
    return x*x;
}

int main() {
    // int
    int sqr_of_five = square(5);
    cout << sqr_of_five << endl;
    // double
    cout << (double)square(5.3) << endl;
    // complex
    cout << square( complex<double>(5,3) )
         << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

C++ does a far better job than C in this regard.
But for more complex functions the syntax can be hard to follow: see


=> http://bartoszmilewski.com/2009/10/21/what-does-haskell-have-to-do-with-c/ this article
 for example.

In C++ you must declare that a function can work with different types.
In Haskell, the opposite is the case.
The function will be as general as possible by default.

Type inference gives Haskell the feeling of freedom that dynamically typed
languages provide.
But unlike dynamically typed languages, most errors are caught before run
time.
Generally, in Haskell:

______
  "if it compiles it certainly does what you intended"
______

### Type construction

You can construct your own types.
First, you can use aliases or type synonyms.

```haskell :tangle type_constr_1.hs
type Name   = String
type Color  = String

showInfos :: Name ->  Color -> String
showInfos name color =  "Name: " ++ name
                        ++ ", Color: " ++ color
name :: Name
name = "Robin"
color :: Color
color = "Blue"
main = putStrLn $ showInfos name color
```

But it doesn't protect you much.
Try to swap the two parameter of =showInfos= and run the program:

```haskell
putStrLn $ showInfos color name
```

It will compile and execute.
In fact you can replace Name, Color and String everywhere.
The compiler will treat them as completely identical.

Another method is to create your own types using the keyword =data=.

```haskell
data Name   = NameConstr String
data Color  = ColorConstr String

showInfos :: Name ->  Color -> String
showInfos (NameConstr name) (ColorConstr color) =
      "Name: " ++ name ++ ", Color: " ++ color

name  = NameConstr "Robin"
color = ColorConstr "Blue"
main = putStrLn $ showInfos name color
```

Now if you switch parameters of =showInfos=, the compiler complains!
So this is a potential mistake you will never make again and the only price
is to be a bit more verbose.

Also notice that constructors are functions:

```haskell
NameConstr  :: String -> Name
ColorConstr :: String -> Color
```

The syntax of =data= is mainly:

```haskell
data TypeName =   ConstructorName  [types]
                | ConstructorName2 [types]
                | ...
```

Generally the usage is to use the same name for the DataTypeName and
DataTypeConstructor.

Example:

```haskell
data Complex a = Num a => Complex a a
```

Also you can use the record syntax:

```haskell
data DataTypeName = DataConstructor {
                      field1 :: [type of field1]
                    , field2 :: [type of field2]
                    ...
                    , fieldn :: [type of fieldn] }
```

And many accessors are made for you.
Furthermore you can use another order when setting values.

Example:

```haskell
data Complex a = Num a => Complex { real :: a, img :: a}
c = Complex 1.0 2.0
z = Complex { real = 3, img = 4 }
real c â 1.0
img z â 4
```

### Recursive type

You already encountered a recursive type: lists.
You can re-create lists, but with a more verbose syntax:

```haskell
data List a = Empty | Cons a (List a)
```

If you really want to use an easier syntax you can use an infix name for
constructors.

```haskell
infixr 5 :::
data List a = Nil | a ::: (List a)
```

The number after =infixr= gives the precedence.

If you want to be able to print (=Show=), read (=Read=), test equality
(=Eq=) and compare (=Ord=) your new data structure you can tell Haskell to
derive the appropriate functions for you.

```haskell :tangle list.hs
infixr 5 :::
data List a = Nil | a ::: (List a)
              deriving (Show,Read,Eq,Ord)
```

When you add =deriving (Show)= to your data declaration, Haskell creates a
=show= function for you.
We'll see soon how you can use your own =show= function.

```haskell :tangle list.hs
convertList [] = Nil
convertList (x:xs) = x ::: convertList xs
```

```haskell :tangle list.hs
main = do
      print (0 ::: 1 ::: Nil)
      print (convertList [0,1])
```

This prints:

______
0 ::: (1 ::: Nil)
0 ::: (1 ::: Nil)
______

### Trees

caption:  Magritte, l'Arbre
=> ./magritte-l-arbre.jpg

We'll just give another standard example: binary trees.

```haskell :tangle tree.hs
data BinTree a = Empty
                 | Node a (BinTree a) (BinTree a)
                              deriving (Show)
```

We will also create a function which turns a list into an ordered binary
tree.

```haskell :tangle tree.hs
treeFromList :: (Ord a) => [a] -> BinTree a
treeFromList [] = Empty
treeFromList (x:xs) = Node x (treeFromList (filter (<x) xs))
                             (treeFromList (filter (>x) xs))
```

Look at how elegant this function is. In plain English:

* an empty list will be converted to an empty tree.
* a list =(x:xs)= will be converted to a tree where:

  - The root is =x=
  - Its left subtree is the tree created from members of the list =xs=
    which are strictly inferior to =x= and
  - the right subtree is the tree created from members of the list =xs=
    which are strictly superior to =x=.

```haskell :tangle tree.hs
main = print $ treeFromList [7,2,4,8]
```

You should obtain the following:

______
Node 7 (Node 2 Empty (Node 4 Empty Empty)) (Node 8 Empty Empty)
______

This is an informative but quite unpleasant representation of our tree.

I've added the =containers= package in the =shell.nix= file, it is time to
use this library which contain functions to show trees and list of trees
(forest) named =drawTree= and =drawForest=.

```haskell :tangle pretty_tree.hs
import           Data.Tree (Tree,Forest(..))
import qualified Data.Tree as Tree

data BinTree a = Empty
               | Node a (BinTree a) (BinTree a)
               deriving (Eq,Ord,Show)

treeFromList :: (Ord a) => [a] -> BinTree a
treeFromList [] = Empty
treeFromList (x:xs) = Node x (treeFromList (filter (<x) xs))
                      (treeFromList (filter (>x) xs))

-- | Function to transform our internal BinTree type to the
-- type of Tree declared in Data.Tree (from containers package)
-- so that the function Tree.drawForest can use
binTreeToForestString :: (Show a) => BinTree a -> Forest String
binTreeToForestString Empty = []
binTreeToForestString (Node x left right) =
  [Tree.Node (show x) ((binTreeToForestString left) ++ (binTreeToForestString right))]

-- | Function that given a BinTree print a representation of it in the console
prettyPrintTree :: (Show a) => BinTree a -> IO ()
prettyPrintTree = putStrLn . Tree.drawForest . binTreeToForestString

main = do
  putStrLn "Int binary tree:"
  prettyPrintTree $ treeFromList [7,2,4,8,1,3,6,21,12,23]
  putStrLn "\nNote we could also use another type\n"
  putStrLn "String binary tree:"
  prettyPrintTree $
    treeFromList ["foo","bar","baz","gor","yog"]
  putStrLn "\nAs we can test equality and order trees, we can make tree of trees!\n"
  putStrLn "\nBinary tree of Char binary trees:"
  prettyPrintTree (treeFromList
                    (map treeFromList ["foo","bar","zara","baz","foo"]))
```

______
~/t/hsenv> runghc pretty_tree.hs
Int binary tree:
7
|
+- 2
|  |
|  +- 1
|  |
|  `- 4
|     |
|     +- 3
|     |
|     `- 6
|
`- 8
   |
   `- 21
      |
      +- 12
      |
      `- 23

Note we could also use another type

String binary tree:
"foo"
|
+- "bar"
|  |
|  `- "baz"
|
`- "gor"
   |
   `- "yog"

As we can test equality and order trees, we can make tree of trees!

Binary tree of Char binary trees:
Node 'f' Empty (Node 'o' Empty Empty)
|
+- Node 'b' (Node 'a' Empty Empty) (Node 'r' Empty Empty)
|  |
|  `- Node 'b' (Node 'a' Empty Empty) (Node 'z' Empty Empty)
|
`- Node 'z' (Node 'a' Empty (Node 'r' Empty Empty)) Empty
______

Notice how duplicate elements aren't inserted in trees.
For exemple the Char BinTree constructed from the list =foo= is
just =f -> o=.
When =o= is inserted another time the second =o= is not duplicated.
But more importantly it works also for our own =BinTree= notice how the
tree for =foo= is inserted only once.
We have this for (almost) free, because we have declared Tree to be an
instance of =Eq=.

See how awesome this structure is: we can make trees containing not only
integers, strings and chars, but also other trees.
And we can even make a tree containing a tree of trees!

### More Advanced Types

So far we have presented types that are close to types we can see in most
typed programming languages.
But the real strength of Haskell is its type system.
So I will try to give you an idea about what makes the Haskell type system
more advanced than in most languages.

So as comparison, classical types/schemas, etc... are about products of
different sub-types:

```haskell
data ProductType = P Int String
data PersonRecord = Person { age :: Int, name :: String }
```

Haskell has also a notion of =sum types= that I often lack a lot in other
programming languages I use.

You can define your type as a sum:

```haskell
data Point = D1 Int | D2 Int Int | D3 Int Int Int
```

So far so good.
Sum types are already a nice thing to have, in particular within Haskell
because now the compiler can warn you if you miss a case.
For example if you write:

```haskell
case point of
  D1 x -> ...
  D2 x y -> ...
```

If you compile with the =-Wall= flag (as you should always do for serious
development) then the compiler will warn you that you are forgetting some
possible value.

Those are still not really advanced types.
Advanced type are higher order types.
Those are the one that help with making your code more polymorphic.

We will start with example I alreday provided, lists:

```haskell
data MyList a = Cons a (MyList a) | Nil
```

As you can see =MyList= takes a type parameter.
So =MyList= is a higher order type.
Generally, the intuition behind type is that a type is a data structure or
a container.
But in fact, Haskell types can be or can contain functions.
This is for example the case for =IO=.
And this is why it can be confusing to read the type of some functions.
I will take as example =sequenceA=:

```haskell
sequenceA :: Applicative f => t (f a) -> f (t a)
```

So if you read this, it can be quite difficult to grasp what is the
intended use of this function.
A simple technique for example, is to try to replace the higher order types
(here =t= and =f=) by a type you can have some intuition about.
For example consider =t= to be the higher order type =Tree= and =f= to be
the higher order type =[]= (list).

Now you can see that =sequenceA= sill take a Tree of lists and will return
a list of trees.
For it to work =[]= need to be part of the =Applicative= class type (which
is the case).
I will not enter into the details about what =Applicative= type class is
here.
But just with this, you should start to have a better intuition about what
=sequenceA= is about.

## Infinite Structures

caption:  Escher
=> ./escher_infinite_lizards.jpg

It is often said that Haskell is /lazy/.

In fact, if you are a bit pedantic, you should say that [[http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Lazy_vs._non-strict][Haskell is
/non-strict/]].
Laziness is just a common implementation for non-strict languages.

Then what does "not-strict" mean? From the Haskell wiki:

______
Reduction (the mathematical term for evaluation) proceeds from the
outside in.

so if you have =(a+(b*c))= then you first reduce =+= first, then you
reduce the inner =(b*c)=
______

For example in Haskell you can do:

```haskell
-- numbers = [1,2,..]
numbers :: [Integer]
numbers = 0:map (1+) numbers

take' n [] = []
take' 0 l = []
take' n (x:xs) = x:take' (n-1) xs

main = print $ take' 10 numbers
```

And it stops.

How?

Instead of trying to evaluate =numbers= entirely, it evaluates elements
only when needed.

Also, note in Haskell there is a notation for infinite lists

______
[1..]   â [1,2,3,4...]
[1,3..] â [1,3,5,7,9,11...]
______

and most functions will work with them. Also, there is a built-in
function =take= which is equivalent to our =take'=.

### Infinite Trees

```haskell :tangle infinite_tree.hs :exports none
  import           Data.Tree (Tree,Forest(..))
  import qualified Data.Tree as Tree

  data BinTree a = Empty
                 | Node a (BinTree a) (BinTree a)
                 deriving (Eq,Ord,Show)

  -- | Function to transform our internal BinTree type to the
  -- type of Tree declared in Data.Tree (from containers package)
  -- so that the function Tree.drawForest can use
  binTreeToForestString :: (Show a) => BinTree a -> Forest String
  binTreeToForestString Empty = []
  binTreeToForestString (Node x left right) =
    [Tree.Node (show x) ((binTreeToForestString left) ++ (binTreeToForestString right))]

  -- | Function that given a BinTree print a representation of it in the console
  prettyPrintTree :: (Show a) => BinTree a -> IO ()
  prettyPrintTree = putStrLn . Tree.drawForest . binTreeToForestString
```


Suppose we don't mind having an ordered binary tree.
Here is an infinite binary tree:

```haskell :tangle infinite_tree.hs
nullTree = Node 0 nullTree nullTree
```

A complete binary tree where each node is equal to 0.
Now I will prove you can manipulate this object using the following
function:

```haskell :tangle infinite_tree.hs
-- take all element of a BinTree
-- up to some depth
treeTakeDepth _ Empty = Empty
treeTakeDepth 0 _     = Empty
treeTakeDepth n (Node x left right) = let
          nl = treeTakeDepth (n-1) left
          nr = treeTakeDepth (n-1) right
          in
              Node x nl nr
```

See what occurs for this program:

```haskell :tangle infinite_tree.hs
main = prettyPrintTree (treeTakeDepth 4 nullTree)
```

This code compiles, runs and stops giving the following result:

Just to heat up your neurones a bit more, let's make a slightly more
interesting tree:


```haskell :tangle infinite_tree_2.hs :exports none
  import           Data.Tree (Tree,Forest(..))
  import qualified Data.Tree as Tree

  data BinTree a = Empty
                 | Node a (BinTree a) (BinTree a)
                 deriving (Eq,Ord,Show)

  -- | Function to transform our internal BinTree type to the
  -- type of Tree declared in Data.Tree (from containers package)
  -- so that the function Tree.drawForest can use
  binTreeToForestString :: (Show a) => BinTree a -> Forest String
  binTreeToForestString Empty = []
  binTreeToForestString (Node x left right) =
    [Tree.Node (show x) ((binTreeToForestString left) ++ (binTreeToForestString right))]

  -- | Function that given a BinTree print a representation of it in the console
  prettyPrintTree :: (Show a) => BinTree a -> IO ()
  prettyPrintTree = putStrLn . Tree.drawForest . binTreeToForestString

  -- | take all element of a BinTree up to some depth
  treeTakeDepth _ Empty = Empty
  treeTakeDepth 0 _     = Empty
  treeTakeDepth n (Node x left right) = let
            nl = treeTakeDepth (n-1) left
            nr = treeTakeDepth (n-1) right
            in
                Node x nl nr
```


```haskell :tangle infinite_tree_2.hs
iTree = Node 0 (dec iTree) (inc iTree)
        where
           dec (Node x l r) = Node (x-1) (dec l) (dec r)
           inc (Node x l r) = Node (x+1) (inc l) (inc r)
```

Another way to create this tree is to use a higher order function.
This function should be similar to =map=, but should work on =BinTree=
instead of list.
Here is such a function:

```haskell :tangle infinite_tree_2.hs
-- apply a function to each node of Tree
treeMap :: (a -> b) -> BinTree a -> BinTree b
treeMap f Empty = Empty
treeMap f (Node x left right) = Node (f x)
                                     (treeMap f left)
                                     (treeMap f right)
```

/Hint/: I won't talk more about this here.
If you are interested in the generalization of =map= to other data
structures, search for functor and =fmap=.

Our definition is now:

```haskell :tangle infinite_tree_2.hs
infTreeTwo :: BinTree Int
infTreeTwo = Node 0 (treeMap (\x -> x-1) infTreeTwo)
                    (treeMap (\x -> x+1) infTreeTwo)
```

Look at the result for

```haskell :tangle infinite_tree_2.hs
main = prettyPrintTree $ treeTakeDepth 4 infTreeTwo
```

### Fibonnacci infinite list

The important things to remember.
Haskell handle infinite structures naturally mostly because it is not strict.

So you can write, infinite tree, but also, you can generate infinite list
like this common example:

```haskell :tangle fib_lazy.hs
fib :: [Integer]
fib = 1:1:zipWith (+) fib (tail fib)

main = traverse print (take 20 (drop 200 fib))
```

Many new details in this small code. Don't worry if you do not get all details:

* =fib= is a list of Integer, not a function
* =drop n= remove n element of a list
* =take n= keep the first n elements of a list
* =zipWith op [a1,a2,a3,...] [b1,b2,b3,...]= will generate the list
  =[op a1 b1,op a2 b2,op a3 b3, .... ]=
* =traverse= is like map but for performing effects (in this case print)

This progam print all fibonnacci numbers from 201 to 221 instantaneously.
Because, =fib= is a list that will be used as "cache" to compute each
number even considering the code looks a bit like a double recursion.

Let's see how this work using =Debug.Trace=:

```haskell :tangle fib_lazy_trace.hs
import Debug.Trace

-- like + but each time this is evaluated print a trace
tracedPlus x y = trace ("> " ++ show x ++ " + " ++ show y) (x + y)

fib :: [Integer]
fib = 1:1:zipWith tracedPlus fib (tail fib)

main = do
  print (fib !! 10)
  print (fib !! 12)
```

______

Notice how, once computed, the list is kept in memory.
This is why when the second time we ask for the 12th element of fib we only
perform two more additions.
This is both a blessing and a curse.
A blessing if you know when to use this as in this example.
And a curse as if do not take care about lazyness it will come back at you
with memory leaks.

After a bit of experience, most Haskellers can avoid memory leaks naturally.

# Dive into the impure

Congratulations for getting so far!

You have been introduced to the functional style and how to deal with
/pure/ code.
Understand code that is only evaluated without changing the state of the
external world.

If you are like me, you should get the functional style.
You should also understand a bit more the advantages of laziness by
default.
But you also don't really understand where to start in order to make a real
program.
And in particular:

* How do you deal with effects?
* Why is there a strange imperative-like notation for dealing with IO?

Be prepared, the answers might be complex.
But they are all very rewarding.

In this section you will first introduced about how to /use/ IO.
That should not be that hard.
Then, a harder section should explain how IO works.
And the last part will talk about how we can generalize why we learned so
far with IO to many different types.

## Deal With IO

caption:  Magritte, Carte blanche
=> ./magritte_carte_blanche.jpg

______
{{{tldr}}}

A typical function doing =IO= looks a lot like an imperative program:

```haskell
f :: IO a
f = do
  x <- action1
  action2 x
  y <- action3
  action4 x y
```

* To set a value to an object we use =<-= .
* The type of each line is =IO *=; in this example:

  ```haskell
  - action1     :: IO b
  - x           :: b
  - action2 x   :: IO ()
  - action3     :: IO c
  - y           :: c
  - action4 x y :: IO a
  ```

* Few objects have the type =IO a=, this should help you choose. In
  particular you cannot use pure functions directly here. To use pure
  functions you could do =action2 (purefunction x)= for example.
______

In this section, I will explain how to use IO, not how it works.
You'll see how Haskell separates the pure from the impure parts of the
program.

Don't stop because you're trying to understand the details of the syntax.
Answers will come in the next section.

What to achieve?

______
Ask a user to enter a list of numbers.
Print the sum of the numbers.
______

```haskell :tangle io_sum.hs
toList :: String -> [Integer]
toList input = read ("[" ++ input ++ "]")

main = do
  putStrLn "Enter a list of numbers (separated by comma):"
  input <- getLine
  print $ sum (toList input)
```

It should be straightforward to understand the behavior of this program.
Let's analyze the types in more detail.

```haskell
putStrLn :: String -> IO ()
getLine  :: IO String
print    :: Show a => a -> IO ()
```

Or more interestingly, we note that each expression in the =do= block has a
type of =IO a=.

```haskell
main = do
  putStrLn "Enter ... " :: IO ()
  getLine               :: IO String
  print Something       :: IO ()
```

We should also pay attention to the effect of the =<-= symbol.

```haskell
do
  x <- something
```

If =something :: IO a= then =x :: a=.

Another important note about using =IO=: all lines in a do block must be of
one of the two forms:

```haskell
  action1 :: IO a
          -- in this case, generally a = ()
```

or

```haskell
  value <- action2    -- where
                      -- action2 :: IO b
                      -- value   :: b
```

These two kinds of line will correspond to two different ways of sequencing
actions.
The meaning of this sentence should be clearer by the end of the next
section.

Now let's see how this program behaves.
For example, what happens if the user enters something strange?
Let's try:

______
[hs:hsenv]> runghc io_sum.hs
Enter a list of numbers (separated by comma):
foo
Prelude.read: no parse
______

Argh!
An evil error message and a crash!
Our first improvement will simply be to answer with a more friendly
message.

In order to do this, we must detect that something went wrong.
Here is one way to do this: use the type =Maybe=.
This is a very common type in Haskell.

```haskell :tangle io_sum_safe.hs
import Data.Maybe
import Text.Read (readMaybe)
```

What is this thing?
=Maybe= is a type which takes one parameter.
Its definition is:

```haskell
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
```

This is a nice way to tell there was an error while trying to
create/compute a value.
The =readMaybe= function is a great example of this.
This is a function similar to the function =read=[fn:4], but if something
goes wrong the returned value is =Nothing=.
If the value is right, it returns =Just <the value>=.

Now to be a bit more readable, we define a function which goes like this:
If the string has the wrong format, it will return =Nothing=.
Otherwise, for example for "1,2,3", it will return =Just [1,2,3]=.

```haskell :tangle io_sum_safe.hs
getListFromString :: String -> Maybe [Integer]
getListFromString str = readMaybe $ "[" ++ str ++ "]"
```

We simply have to test the value in our main function.

```haskell :tangle io_sum_safe.hs
main :: IO ()
main = do
  putStrLn "Enter a list of numbers (separated by comma):"
  input <- getLine
  let maybeList = getListFromString input
  case maybeList of
    Just l  -> print (sum l)
    Nothing -> putStrLn "Bad format. Good Bye."
```

In case of error, we display a nice error message.

Note that the type of each expression in the main's =do= block remains of
the form =IO a=.

One very important thing to note is the type of all the functions defined
so far.
There is only one function which contains =IO= in its type: =main=.
This means main is impure.
But main uses =getListFromString= which is pure.
So it's clear just by looking at declared types which functions are pure
and which are impure.

Why does purity matter? Among the many advantages, here are three:

* It is far easier to think about pure code than impure code.
* Purity protects you from all the hard-to-reproduce bugs that are due
  to side effects.
* You can evaluate pure functions in any order or in parallel without
  risk.

This is why you should generally put as most code as possible inside pure
functions.

Our next iteration will be to prompt the user again and again until she
enters a valid answer.

We keep the first part:

```haskell :tangle io_sum_ask.hs
import Data.Maybe
import Text.Read (readMaybe)

getListFromString :: String -> Maybe [Integer]
getListFromString str = readMaybe $ "[" ++ str ++ "]"
```

Now we create a function which will ask the user for an list of integers
until the input is right.

```haskell :tangle io_sum_ask.hs
askUser :: IO [Integer]
askUser = do
  putStrLn "Enter a list of numbers (separated by comma):"
  input <- getLine
  let maybeList = getListFromString input
  case maybeList of
      Just l  -> return l
      Nothing -> askUser
```

This function is of type =IO [Integer]=.
Such a type means that we retrieved a value of type =[Integer]= through
some IO actions.
Some people might explain while waving their hands:

______
  Â«This is an =[Integer]= inside an =IO=.Â»
______

If you want to understand the details behind all of this, you'll have to
read the next section.
But really, if you just want to /use/ IO just practice a little and
remember to think about the type.

Finally our main function is much simpler:

```haskell :tangle io_sum_ask.hs
main :: IO ()
main = do
  list <- askUser
  print $ sum list
```

We have finished with our introduction to =IO=.
This was quite fast.
Here are the main things to remember:

* in the =do= block, each expression must have the type =IO a=. You are
  then limited with regard to the range of expressions available. For
  example, =getLine=, =print=, =putStrLn=, etc...
* Try to externalize the pure functions as much as possible.
* the =IO a= type means: an IO /action/ which returns an element of type
  =a=. =IO= represents actions; under the hood, =IO a= is the type of a
  function. Read the next section if you are curious.

If you practice a bit, you should be able to /use/ =IO=.

## IO trick explained

caption:  Magritte, ceci n'est pas une pipe
=> ./magritte_pipe.jpg

______
{{{tldr}}}

To separate pure and impure parts, =main= is defined as a function which
modifies the state of the world.

______
main :: World -> World
______

A function is guaranteed to have side effects only if it has this type.
But look at a typical main function:

```haskell
main w0 =
    let (v1,w1) = action1 w0 in
    let (v2,w2) = action2 v1 w1 in
    let (v3,w3) = action3 v2 w2 in
    action4 v3 w3
```

We have a lot of temporary elements (here =w1=, =w2= and =w3=) which must
be passed on to the next action.

We create a function =bind= or ~(>>=)~.
With =bind= we don't need temporary names anymore.

```haskell
main =
  action1 >>= action2 >>= action3 >>= action4
```

Bonus: Haskell has syntactical sugar for us:

```haskell
main = do
  v1 <- action1
  v2 <- action2 v1
  v3 <- action3 v2
  action4 v3
```
______

Why did we use this strange syntax, and what exactly is this =IO= type?
It looks a bit like magic.

For now let's just forget all about the pure parts of our program, and
focus on the impure parts:

```haskell
askUser :: IO [Integer]
askUser = do
  putStrLn "Enter a list of numbers (separated by commas):"
  input <- getLine
  let maybeList = getListFromString input
  case maybeList of
      Just l  -> return l
      Nothing -> askUser

main :: IO ()
main = do
  list <- askUser
  print $ sum list
```

First remark: this looks imperative.
Haskell is powerful enough to make impure code look imperative.
For example, if you wish you could create a =while= in Haskell.
In fact, for dealing with =IO=, an imperative style is generally more
appropriate.

But you should have noticed that the notation is a bit unusual.
Here is why, in detail.

In an impure language, the state of the world can be seen as a huge hidden
global variable.
This hidden variable is accessible by all functions of your language.
For example, you can read and write a file in any function.
Whether a file exists or not is a difference in the possible states that
the world can take.

In Haskell the current state of the world is not hidden.
Rather, it is /explicitly/ said that =main= is a function that
/potentially/ changes the state of the world.
Its type is then something like:

```haskell
main :: World -> World
```

Not all functions may access this variable.
Those which have access to this variable are impure.
Functions to which the world variable isn't provided are pure[fn:5].

Haskell considers the state of the world as an input variable to =main=.
But the real type of main is closer to this one[fn:6]:

```haskell
main :: World -> ((),World)
```

The =()= type is the unit type. Nothing to see here.

Now let's rewrite our main function with this in mind:

```haskell
main w0 =
    let (list,w1) = askUser w0 in
    let (x,w2) = print (sum list,w1) in
    x
```

First, we note that all functions which have side effects must have the
type:

```haskell
World -> (a,World)
```

where =a= is the type of the result.
For example, a =getChar= function should have the type =World -> (Char,
World)=.

Another thing to note is the trick to fix the order of evaluation.
In Haskell, in order to evaluate =f a b=, you have many choices:

* first eval =a= then =b= then =f a b=
* first eval =b= then =a= then =f a b=.
* eval =a= and =b= in parallel then =f a b=

This is true because we're working in a pure part of the language.

Now, if you look at the main function, it is clear you must eval the first
line before the second one since to evaluate the second line you have to
get a parameter given by the evaluation of the first line.

This trick works like a charm.
The compiler will at each step provide a pointer to a new real world id.
Under the hood, =print= will evaluate as:

* print something on the screen
* modify the id of the world
* evaluate as =((),new world id)=.

Now, if you look at the style of the main function, it is clearly awkward.
Let's try to do the same to the =askUser= function:

```haskell
askUser :: World -> ([Integer],World)
```

Before:

```haskell
askUser :: IO [Integer]
askUser = do
  putStrLn "Enter a list of numbers:"
  input <- getLine
  let maybeList = getListFromString input in
      case maybeList of
          Just l  -> return l
          Nothing -> askUser
```

After:

```haskell
askUser w0 =
    let (_,w1)     = putStrLn "Enter a list of numbers:" in
    let (input,w2) = getLine w1 in
    let (l,w3)     = case getListFromString input of
                      Just l   -> (l,w2)
                      Nothing  -> askUser w2
    in
        (l,w3)
```

This is similar, but awkward. Look at all these temporary =w?= names.

The lesson is: naive IO implementation in Pure functional languages is
awkward!

Fortunately, there is a better way to handle this problem.
We see a pattern.
Each line is of the form:

```haskell
  let (y,w') = action x w in
```

Even if for some lines the first =x= argument isn't needed.
The output type is a couple, =(answer, newWorldValue)=.
Each function =f= must have a type similar to:

```haskell
f :: World -> (a,World)
```

Not only this, but we can also note that we always follow the same usage
pattern:

```haskell
  let (y,w1) = action1 w0 in
  let (z,w2) = action2 w1 in
  let (t,w3) = action3 w2 in
  ...
```

Each action can take from 0 to n parameters.
And in particular, each action can take a parameter from the result of a
line above.

For example, we could also have:

```haskell
  let (_,w1) = action1 x w0   in
  let (z,w2) = action2 w1     in
  let (_,w3) = action3 z w2 in
  ...
```

With, of course: =actionN w :: (World) -> (a,World)=.

______
*IMPORTANT*: there are only two important patterns to consider:

```haskell
  let (x,w1) = action1 w0 in
  let (y,w2) = action2 x w1 in
```

and

```haskell
  let (_,w1) = action1 w0 in
  let (y,w2) = action2 w1 in
```
______

caption:  Slave Market with the disappearing bust of Voltaire
=> ./slave-market-with-the-disappearing-bust-of-voltaire.jpg

Now, we will do a magic trick.
We will make the temporary world symbols /disappear/.
We will =bind= the two lines.
Let's define the =bind= function.
Its type is quite intimidating at first:

```haskell
bind :: (World -> (a,World))
        -> (a -> (World -> (b,World)))
        -> (World -> (b,World))
```

But remember that =(World -> (a,World))= is the type for an IO action.
Now let's rename it for clarity:

```haskell
type IO a = World -> (a, World)
```

Some examples of functions:

```haskell
getLine :: IO String
print :: Show a => a -> IO ()
```

=getLine= is an IO action which takes world as a parameter and returns a
couple =(String, World)=.
This can be summarized as: =getLine= is of type =IO String=, which we also
see as an IO action which will return a String "embeded inside an IO".

The function =print= is also interesting.
It takes one argument which can be shown.
In fact it takes two arguments.
The first is the value to print and the other is the state of world.
It then returns a couple of type =((), World)=.
This means that it changes the state of the world, but doesn't yield any
more data.

This new =IO a= type helps us simplify the type of =bind=:

```haskell
    bind :: IO a
            -> (a -> IO b)
            -> IO b
```

It says that =bind= takes two IO actions as parameters and returns another
IO action.

Now, remember the /important/ patterns.
The first was:

```haskell
pattern1 w0 =
  let (x,w1) = action1 w0 in
  let (y,w2) = action2 x w1 in
  (y,w2)
```

Look at the types:

```haskell
action1  :: IO a
action2  :: a -> IO b
pattern1 :: IO b
```

Doesn't it seem familiar?

```haskell
(bind action1 action2) w0 =
    let (x, w1) = action1 w0
        (y, w2) = action2 x w1
    in  (y, w2)
```

The idea is to hide the World argument with this function.
As an example imagine if we wanted to simulate:

```haskell
let (line1, w1) = getLine w0 in
let ((), w2) = print line1 in
((), w2)
```

Now, using the =bind= function:

```haskell
(res, w2) = (bind getLine print) w0
```

As print is of type ~Show a => a -> (World -> ((), World))~, we know
~res = ()~ (=unit= type).
If you didn't see what was magic here, let's try with three lines this
time.

```haskell
  let (line1,w1) = getLine w0 in
  let (line2,w2) = getLine w1 in
  let ((),w3) = print (line1 ++ line2) in
  ((),w3)
```

Which is equivalent to:

```haskell
(res,w3) = (bind getLine (\line1 ->
             (bind getLine (\line2 ->
               print (line1 ++ line2))))) w0
```

Didn't you notice something?
Yes, no temporary World variables are used anywhere!
This is /MA/. /GIC/.

We can use a better notation.
Let's use ~(>>=)~ instead of =bind=.
~(>>=)~ is an infix function like ~(+)~; reminder ~3 + 4 â (+) 3 4~

```haskell
(res,w3) = (getLine >>=
           (\line1 -> getLine >>=
           (\line2 -> print (line1 ++ line2)))) w0
```

Merry Christmas Everyone!
Haskell has made syntactical sugar for us:

```haskell
  do
    x <- action1
    y <- action2
    z <- action3
    ...
```

Is replaced by:

```haskell
  action1 >>= (\x ->
  action2 >>= (\y ->
  action3 >>= (\z ->
  ...
  )))
```

Note that you can use =x= in =action2= and =x= and =y= in =action3=.

But what about the lines not using the ~<-~?
Easy, another function =blindBind=:

```haskell
blindBind :: IO a -> IO b -> IO b
blindBind action1 action2 w0 =
    bind action (\_ -> action2) w0
```

I didn't simplify this definition for the purposes of clarity.
Of course, we can use a better notation: we'll use the =(>>)= operator.

And

```haskell
do
    action1
    action2
    action3
```

Is transformed into

```haskell
action1 >>
action2 >>
action3
```

Also, another function is quite useful.

```haskell
putInIO :: a -> IO a
putInIO x = IO (\w -> (x,w))
```

This is the general way to put pure values inside the "IO context".
The general name for =putInIO= is =pure= but you also see very often =return=.
Historically =pure= was called =return=.
This is quite a bad name when you learn Haskell.
=return= is very different from what you might be used to.

To finish, let's translate our example:

```haskell
askUser :: IO [Integer]
askUser = do
  putStrLn "Enter a list of numbers (separated by commas):"
  input <- getLine
  let maybeList = getListFromString input in
      case maybeList of
          Just l  -> return l
          Nothing -> askUser

main :: IO ()
main = do
  list <- askUser
  print $ sum list
```

Is translated into:

```haskell :tangle io_bind.hs
import Data.Maybe
import Text.Read (readMaybe)

getListFromString :: String -> Maybe [Integer]
getListFromString str = readMaybe $ "[" ++ str ++ "]"
askUser :: IO [Integer]
askUser =
    putStrLn "Enter a list of numbers (sep. by commas):" >>
    getLine >>= \input ->
    let maybeList = getListFromString input in
      case maybeList of
        Just l -> return l
        Nothing -> askUser

main :: IO ()
main = askUser >>=
  \list -> print $ sum list
```

You can compile this code to verify that it works.

Imagine what it would look like without the =(>>)= and =(>>=)=.

## Monads

______
caption:  Dali, reve. It represents a weapon out of the
mouth of a tiger, itself out of the mouth of another tiger, itself out
of the mouth of a fish itself out of a grenade.
=> ./dali_reve.jpg
______

Now the secret can be revealed: =IO= is a /monad/.
Being a monad means you have access to some syntactical sugar with the =do=
notation.
But mainly, you have access to a coding pattern which will ease the flow of
your code.

______
*Important remarks*:

* Monad are not necessarily about effects! There are a lot of /pure/
  monads.
* Monad are more about sequencing
______

In Haskell, =Monad= is a type class.
To be an instance of this type class, you must provide the functions
~(>>=)~ and ~return~.
The function ~(>>)~ is derived from ~(>>=)~.
Here is how the type class =Monad= is declared (from

=> https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.12.0.0/docs/src/GHC.Base.html#Monad hackage GHC.Base
):

```haskell
class Applicative m => Monad m where
    -- | Sequentially compose two actions, passing any value produced
    -- by the first as an argument to the second.
    (>>=)       :: forall a b. m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b

    -- | Sequentially compose two actions, discarding any value produced

Remarks:

* the keyword =class= is not your friend. A Haskell class is /not/ a
  class of the kind you will find in object-oriented programming.
  A Haskell class has a lot of similarities with Java interfaces.
  A better word would have been =typeclass=, since that means a set of types.
  For a type to belong to a class, all functions of the class must be
  provided for this type.
* In this particular example of type class, the type =m= must be a type
  that takes an argument.
  For example =IO a=, but also =Maybe a=, =[a]=, etc...
* To be a useful monad, your function must obey some rules.
  If your construction does not obey these rules strange things might happens:
  ```haskell
  return a >>= k  ==  k a
  m >>= return  ==  m
  m >>= (\x -> k x >>= h)  ==  (m >>= k) >>= h
  ```
* Furthermore the =Monad= and =Applicative= operations should relate as follow:
  ```haskell
  pure = return
  (<*>) = ap
  ```
  The above laws imply:
  ```haskell
  fmap f xs = xs >>= return . f
  (>>) = (*>)
  ```

### Monad Intuition

I explained how to use the IO Monad.
In the previous chapter I explained how it works behind the scene.
Notice there is a huge difference between be a client of the Monad API and
be an architect of the Monad API but also have an intuition about what is
really a Monad.

So to try to give you an intuition, just remember a Monad is a construction
that has to do with /composition/ into higher order type constructors
(types with a parameter).
So if we consider ~(<=<)~ and ~(>=>)~ (Kleisli arrow composition) which are
defined (simplified for the purpose of this article) as

```haskell
f >=> g = \x -> f x >>= g
g <=< f = f >=> g
```

Those operation constructed with the bind operator ~(>>=)~ are a
generalisation of ~(.)~ and  ~(>>>)~ where ~f >>> g = g . f~.
If you can look at the type this become visible, simply compare:

```haskell
f :: a -> b
g :: b -> c
g . f :: a -> c
f >>> g :: a -> c
```

with

```haskell
f :: a -> m b
g :: b -> m c
g <=< f :: a -> m c
f >=> g :: a -> m c
```

As I said, this is a generalisation of the composition operation to
functions that returns types within a higher order type constructor.

To give you better example, consider:
* ~m = []~; ~[]~ is a higher order type constructor as it takes a type
  parameter, the /kind/ of this type is ~* -> *~.
  So if values have types, types have /kinds/.
  You can see them in =ghci=:
  ______
  [hs:hsenv]> ghci
  GHCi, version 8.6.5: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
  Prelude> :kind Int
  Int :: *
  Prelude> :kind []
  [] :: * -> *
  ______
  We see that the kind of =Int= is =*= so, it is a monotype, but the kind of
  =[]= is =* -> *= so it takes one type parameter.
* ~a~, ~b~ to be ~Int~ and ~c~ to be ~String~
* ~f n = [n, n+1]~
* ~g n = [show n,">"++show (n+1)]~

So

```haskell
f 2 = [2,3]
g 2 = ["2",">3"]
g 3 = ["3",">4"]
```

One would expect to /combine/ ~f~ and ~g~ such that
~(combine f g) 0 â ["2",">3","3",">4"]~.
Unfortunately ~(.)~ will not work directly and this would be cumbersome to
write.
But thanks to the Monad abstraction we can write:

```haskell
(f >=> g) 2 â ["2",">3","3",">4"]
```

```haskell :tangle monad_composition.hs
import Control.Monad ((>=>))

f :: Int -> [Int]
f n = [n, n+1]

g :: Int -> [String]
g n = [show n,">"++show (n+1)]

main = print $ (f >=> g) 2
```

The next chapters are simply about providing some examples of useful Monads.

### Maybe is a monad

There are a lot of different types that are instances of =Monad=.
One of the easiest to describe is =Maybe=.
If you have a sequence of =Maybe= values, you can use monads to manipulate
them.
It is particularly useful to remove very deep =if..then..else..=
constructions.

Imagine a complex bank operation.
You are eligible to gain about 700â¬ only if you can afford to follow a list
of operations without your balance dipping below zero.

```haskell :tangle maybe_monad_1.hs
deposit  value account = account + value
withdraw value account = account - value

eligible :: (Num a,Ord a) => a -> Bool
eligible account =
  let account1 = deposit 100 account in
    if (account1 < 0)
    then False
    else
      let account2 = withdraw 200 account1 in
      if (account2 < 0)
      then False
      else
        let account3 = deposit 100 account2 in
        if (account3 < 0)
        then False
        else
          let account4 = withdraw 300 account3 in
          if (account4 < 0)
          then False
          else
            let account5 = deposit 1000 account4 in
            if (account5 < 0)
            then False
            else
              True

main = do
  print $ eligible 300 -- True
  print $ eligible 299 -- False
```

Now, let's make it better using Maybe and the fact that it is a Monad.

```haskell :tangle maybe_monad_2.hs
deposit :: (Num a) => a -> a -> Maybe a
deposit value account = Just (account + value)

withdraw :: (Num a,Ord a) => a -> a -> Maybe a
withdraw value account = if (account < value)
                         then Nothing
                         else Just (account - value)

eligible :: (Num a, Ord a) => a -> Maybe Bool
eligible account = do
  account1 <- deposit 100 account
  account2 <- withdraw 200 account1
  account3 <- deposit 100 account2
  account4 <- withdraw 300 account3
  account5 <- deposit 1000 account4
  Just True

main = do
  print $ eligible 300 -- Just True
  print $ eligible 299 -- Nothing
```

Not bad, but we can make it even better:

```haskell :tangle maybe_monad_3.hs
deposit :: (Num a) => a -> a -> Maybe a
deposit value account = Just (account + value)

withdraw :: (Num a,Ord a) => a -> a -> Maybe a
withdraw value account = if (account < value) 
                         then Nothing 
                         else Just (account - value)

eligible :: (Num a, Ord a) => a -> Maybe Bool
eligible account =
  deposit 100 account >>=
  withdraw 200 >>=
  deposit 100  >>=
  withdraw 300 >>=
  deposit 1000 >>
  return True

main = do
  print $ eligible 300 -- Just True
  print $ eligible 299 -- Nothing
```

We have proven that Monads are a good way to make our code more elegant.
Note this idea of code organization, in particular for =Maybe= can be used
in most imperative languages.
In fact, this is the kind of construction we make naturally.

______
An important remark:

The first element in the sequence being evaluated to =Nothing= will
stop the complete evaluation. This means you don't execute all lines.
You get this for free, thanks to laziness.
______

You could also replay these example with the definition of ~(>>=)~ for
=Maybe= in mind:

```haskell
instance Monad Maybe where
    (>>=) :: Maybe a -> (a -> Maybe b) -> Maybe b
    Nothing  >>= _  = Nothing
    (Just x) >>= f  = f x

    return x = Just x
```

The =Maybe= monad proved to be useful while being a very simple example.
We saw the utility of the =IO= monad.
But now for a cooler example, lists.

### The list monad

caption:  Golconde de Magritte
=> ./golconde.jpg

The list monad helps us to simulate non-deterministic computations.
Here we go:

```haskell :tangle list_monad.hs
import Control.Monad (guard)

allCases = [1..10]

resolve :: [(Int,Int,Int)]
resolve = do
              x <- allCases
              y <- allCases
              z <- allCases
              guard $ 4*x + 2*y < z
              return (x,y,z)

main = do
  print resolve
```

MA. GIC. :

______
[(1,1,7),(1,1,8),(1,1,9),(1,1,10),(1,2,9),(1,2,10)]
______

For the list monad, there is also this syntactic sugar (Ã  la Python):

```haskell
  print $ [ (x,y,z) |Â x <- allCases,
                      y <- allCases,
                      z <- allCases,
                      4*x + 2*y < z ]
```

I won't list all the monads, since there are many of them.
Using monads simplifies the manipulation of several notions in pure
languages.
In particular, monads are very useful for:

* IO,
* non-deterministic computation,
* generating pseudo random numbers,
* keeping configuration state,
* writing state,
* ...

If you have followed me until here, then you've done it! You know
monads[fn:7]!

# Start swimming

If you come this far, you can really congratulate yourself.
This is already what I would personnaly call a tremendous achievement.

This chapter will focus on how to build applications with Haskell.
How to use libraries inside your project.

Note application development is easier to introduce than library development.
Mostly because dependency management will be a lot easier.

I first intended to provide a lot more informations about how to create a
project and provide a few project examples.
But it occurs this is harder than I first expected.
So I will just provide the introduction about how to create a starting
point with many pointers for other possible options.

## Start a new project

There are multiple starting options to create a new project.
The most common one is certainly to use =cabal-install=.
Another popular option is to use =stack=.
=stack= adds a layer on top of =cabal-install= and uses fixed set of
libraries known to compile together.
Another method is to =nix= to handle the dependencies and use
=cabal-install= for the rest.
That final choice is often considered as the most complex and difficult for
beginners.
Still this is the one I find the most elegant.
This is the method I will use in this article.

Still, you shall not be intimidated. Look:

* To create a new project the steps will be:
  1. run =nix-shell= (to have =cabal= executable in your PATH)
  2. run =cabal install -i= and answer a few questions
  3. copy a few =.nix= files in your project directory
  4. run another =nix-shell= in your new directory this time to enter in the
     local dev env of your new project.

* To add a new library:
  1. Just add it in the =.cabal= file, and enter again in your =nix-shell=.

I will just walk you through all the steps in detail.
And mostly I will tell you not to take care about most warning messages.
For our end-goal, those are mostly noise.
I am aware of the level of complexity that it looks like at first.
But really most of the apparent complexity is due to poor naming convention
and not to any fundenmental core difficulty.

### Bootstrap a project template files

1. put the

=> shell.nix shell.nix
 file in some directory
2. start =nix-shell --pure=
3. in the nix shell create a new directory and then
4. =cabal init -i=
5. You should use the default value for most questions except:
   1. Should I generate a simple project with sensible defaults? [default: y] n
   2. the package should build "Library AND Executable" (choice 3)
   3. Cabal specification 2.4 (choice 4)
   4. Application directory choose =app= (choice 3)
   5. Library directory choose =lib= (choice 3)
   6. Add informative comments, choose yes.

### Create a few nix files

______
The goal of this tutorial is not to make you learn =nix= because it is a
bit complex, but to explain you a bit, =nix= use a a /configuration language/
and not just a /configuration format/.
So to configure your =nix= environment you endup writing a /nix expression/
in this /nix language/.
And thus you can call the content of one nix-file in another one for
example, or use variables.
______

The first file to create is the one that will pin the versions of all your
packages and libraries:

```nix :tangle my-app/nixpkgs.nix :mkdirp t
import (fetchTarball https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/19.09.tar.gz) {}
```

The second file is the =default.nix= file:

```nix :tangle my-app/default.nix :mkdirp t
{ nixpkgs ? import ./nixpkgs.nix
, compiler ? "default"
, doBenchmark ? false }:
let
  inherit (nixpkgs) pkgs;
  name = "my-app";
  haskellPackages = pkgs.haskellPackages;
  variant = if doBenchmark
            then pkgs.haskell.lib.doBenchmark
            else pkgs.lib.id;
  drv = haskellPackages.callCabal2nix name ./. {};
in
{
  my_project = drv;
  shell = haskellPackages.shellFor {
    # generate hoogle doc
    withHoogle = true;
    packages = p: [drv];
    # packages dependencies (by default haskellPackages)
    buildInputs = with haskellPackages;
      [ hlint
        ghcid
        cabal-install
        cabal2nix
        hindent
        # # if you want to add some system lib like ncurses
        # # you could by writing it like:
        # pkgs.ncurses
      ];
    # nice prompt for the nix-shell
    shellHook = ''
     export PS1="\n\[[${name}:\033[1;32m\]\W\[\033[0m\]]> "
  '';
  };
}
```

It uses the =nixpkgs.nix= file.
But also you can configure it to enable/disable benchmarks while building
your application.
I do not expect you to understand what is really going on here, but a short
explanation is this file take cares of:

1. use the pinned version of nixpkgs and should provide a working set of
   haskell libraries.
2. read you =.cabal= file and find the set of libraries you depends on so
   =nix= will be able to download them.
3. download a few useful packages for Haskell development, in particular
   =hlint=, =ghcid=, =cabal-install=, =cabal2nix= and =hindent=.
   I will talk about those tools later.
4. take care of handling the =nix-shell= prompt so you should see the name
   of your project.

The only things you should manipulate for a new fresh project should be the
=name= and perhaps the =buildInputs= list to add a few more libraries that
could be either Haskell libraries or any library =nix= know about (for
example =ncurses=, in that case you should write it =pkgs.ncurses=).

The two last file simply use the =default.nix= file:

The =shell.nix= file:

```nix :tangle my-app/shell.nix :mkdirp t
(import ./. {}).shell
```

And =release.nix=:

```nix :tangle my-app/release.nix :mkdirp t
let
  def = import ./. {};
in
 { my_project = def.my_project; }
```

So download those files as well as this =.gitignore= file:


```gitignore :tangle my-app/.gitignore :mkdirp t
dist-newstyle/
result
```

### Checking your environment

Now you should see those files in your project:

______

This time, the compilation is not done again.
=cabal= is smart enough not to repeat the compilation again.

______
You could also use =nix-build= to compile your app.
I think this is nice to do for releases.
But for development, you should use =cabal=.
______

### Add a library

______
{{{tldr}}} do not be afraid by the lenght of this section in fact, this is
straightforward.
I just take a lot of time to go through all intermediate steps.

1. add the library in the =build-depends= inside your =.cabal= file.
2. restart =nix-shell= to download the new dependencies.
______

If you open the =my-app.cabal= file in an editor you should see a =library=
section and and =executable my-app= section.
In particular for each section you can see a =build-depends= sub-section as
this one:

```cabal
...
library
  ...
  build-depends:       base ^>=4.12.0.0
  ...
executable my-app
  ...
  build-depends:       base ^>=4.12.0.0, my-app
  ...
```

______
The =^>=4.12.0.0= means that it should use the latest non breaking version
of the haskell package =base=. The author of the =base= package are
responsible not to break the API for minor releases.
Haskell libs uses a 4 number versionning quite similar to the semantic
versionning scheme with just another minor number for non visible changes.
I will not argue much, but mainly, semantic versionning and Haskell
versionning are just a "right to break things to your users".

I don't want to talk a lot more about this, but, it would be nice if more
people would watch this talk[fn:8] related to versionning.

If you want to know more about Haskell versionning convention:

Add the =protolude= lib in the library build-depends like this:

```cabal
...
library
  ...
  build-depends:       base ^>=4.12.0.0,
                       protolude
  ...
executable my-app
  ...
  build-depends:       base ^>=4.12.0.0, my-app
  ...
```

______
I did not include a version constraint here.
This is ok if you do not deploy your library publicly.
This would be absolutely awful if you deploy your library publicly.
So while developing a private app nobody can see except you, nothing is
wrong with this.
But I would encourage you to write those version bounds.
It is sane to do that, but be warned that your lib might rot if you want it
to be part of a working set of libs.
So you might be pinged time to time to update some bounds or to adap your
code to the breaking change of a lib you are using.
Do not think too much about this.
This is generally quite trivial work to do to maintain your lib into a
working lib set.
______

Now that you have added =protolude= modify slightly the code of your app to
use it.
Change the code inside =src/MyLib.hs=:

```haskell :tangle my-app/src/MyLib.hs :mkdirp t
{-# LANGUAGE NoImplicitPrelude #-}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
module MyLib (someFunc) where

import Protolude

someFunc :: IO ()
someFunc = putText "someFunc"
```

Please do not try to search right now about what this change is doing.
It should work mostly as before.
The goal here is just to check that you can use another library easily.

So now you should get out of the =nix-shell= because =nix= dependencies
changed.
Generally just type =^D= (=Ctrl-d=) then launch =nix-shell --pure=.

### Better defaults

Some of the default values in the cabal file are not the best for a
professional and serious application development unfortunately.
First, let create a new block called =common professional-properties=
that will help us not repeat ourselve much and show more warning during compilation.

```cabal
common professional-properties
  default-language: Haskell2010
  build-depends:
    base ^>=4.12.0.0
  ghc-options:
    -Wall
    -Wcompat
    -Wincomplete-uni-patterns
    -Wredundant-constraints
    -Wnoncanonical-monad-instances
    -- -Werror
    -- -O2
```

This should then be used with import in all other sections (=library=,
=executable= and =test=).
Also add the =ghc-options= to enable the use of all core by default.
This might not always be a good idea.
But I think this is generally a better default for most modern application.

```cabal
library
  import: professional-properties
  build-depends: protolude
  ...

executable my-app
  import: professional-properties
  ghc-options:
    -- enable parallelism
    -threaded
    "-with-rtsopts=-N"
  ...

test-suite my-app-test
  import: professional-properties
  ...
```

You can download the final cabal file:

=> my-app/my-app.cabal my-app.cabal


# Conclusion

This was a re-written fast Haskell tutorial.
I will certainly complete this with more advanced tutorial explaining how
to write a few Haskell projects.

Thanks for reading it.

# Thanks

Thanks to

=> http://reddit.com/r/haskell =/r/haskell=
 and

=> http://reddit.com/r/programming =/r/programming=
Your comment were most than welcome.

Particularly, I want to thank

=> https://github.com/Emm Emm
 a thousand times for the time he spent on
correcting my English.
Thank you man.

[fn:1] Even if most recent languages try to hide them, they are present.

[fn:2] I know I'm cheating. But I will talk about non-strictness later.

[fn:3] For the brave, a more complete explanation of pattern matching
       can be found



=> http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/references/haskell/haskell-intro-html/patterns.html here

[fn:4] Which is itself very similar to the javascript =eval= function,
       that is applied to a string containing JSON.

[fn:5] There are some /unsafe/ exceptions to this rule. But you
       shouldn't see such use in a real application except maybe for
       debugging purposes.

[fn:6] For the curious ones, the real type looks like
       =data IO a = IO {unIO :: State# RealWorld -> (# State# RealWorld, a #)}=.
       All the =#= has to do with optimisation.
       I swapped the fields in my example.
       But this is the basic idea.
       As of today, the definition of =IO= is no more visible into =base=.
       We have the following explanation in

=> http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.12.0.0/docs/src/GHC.IO.html =GHC.IO.hs=
:
       ______
       ```
       The IO Monad is just an instance of the ST monad, where the state is
       the real world.  We use the exception mechanism (in GHC.Exception) to
       implement IO exceptions.


       NOTE: The IO representation is deeply wired in to various parts of the
       system.  The following list may or may not be exhaustive:


       Compiler  - types of various primitives in PrimOp.hs


       RTS       - forceIO (StgStartup.cmm)
                 - catchzh_fast, (un)?blockAsyncExceptionszh_fast, raisezh_fast
                   (Exception.cmm)
                 - raiseAsync (RaiseAsync.c)


       Prelude   - GHC.IO.hs, and several other places including
                   GHC.Exception.hs.


       Libraries - parts of hslibs/lang.


       --SDM
       ```
       ______

[fn:7] Well, you'll certainly need to practice a bit to get used to them
       and to understand when you can use them and create your own. But
       you already made a big step in this direction.

# Optimize the size of no js websites

keywords:  blog shell script
description:  Optimize the size of a full static website by taking advantage
description:  of information found in both HTML and CSS.

One of the major problem with CSS and HTML is that they are highly
dependent from each other.
For example, if you want to minimize your CSS, you are still forced to use
the same class names even if they are long.
Because the HTML uses them.
And the same problem arise when you want to minimize the size of your HTML
files.

It means that if you want to minimize a full website you must take care at
the same time of HTML pages as well as CSS pages.
And this is totally impossible to achieve if JS is involved because there
is always the risk the JS code generate class names to manipulate the DOM.

So here is a small script I wanted to write from a long time that do the following:

1. retrieve all class names in the HTML and in the CSS
2. create a map from those long names to shorter names
3. replace the class names in the HTML and CSS files.

So if you have multiple HTML files with:

```html
<div class="long-org-class-generated-by-org-mode">...</div>
```

and CSS files with:

```css
pre .long-org-class-generated-by-org-mode { ... }
```

Those will be replaced by something like:

```html
<div class="av">...</div>
```

and CSS files with:

```css
pre .av { ... }
```

And thus removing many superfluous bytes.

In my personal website, I run this script after minifying my HTML and CSS
with classical tools.
And I still get up to 32% smaller HTML and 22% smaller CSS.

Many 25% smaller HTML if there are a lot of code, because org-mode use very
long class names when generating the code.

Not bad for a very basic solution.

If you want to try it; here is the quick and dirty script I use:

name:  optim-classes.sh
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env zsh

webdir="_site"

retrieve_classes_in_html () {
    cat $webdir/**/*.html(N) | \
        perl -pe 's/class="?([a-zA-Z0-9_-]*)/\nCLASS: $1\n/g'
}

retrieve_classes_in_css () {
    cat $webdir/**/*.css(N) | \
        perl -pe 's/\.([a-zA-Z-_][a-zA-Z0-9-_]*)/\nCLASS: $1\n/g'
}

classes=( $( {retrieve_classes_in_html; retrieve_classes_in_css}| \
                 egrep "^CLASS: [^ ]*$" |\
                 sort -u | \
                 awk 'length($2)>2 {print length($2),$2}'|\
                 sort -rn | \
                 awk '{print $2}') )

chr() {
    [ "$1" -lt 26 ] || return 1
    printf "\\$(printf '%03o' $(( 97 + $1 )))"
}

shortName() {
    if [ "$1" -gt 25 ]; then
        print -- $(shortName $(( ( $1 / 26 ) - 1 )))$(shortName $(( $1 % 26 )))
    else
        chr $1
    fi
}

i=0;
typeset -A assoc
for c in $classes; do
    sn=$(shortName $i)
    print -- "$c -> $sn"
    assoc[$c]=$sn
    ((i++))
done

htmlreplacer=''
cssreplacer=''
for long in $classes; do
    htmlreplacer=$htmlreplacer's#class=("?)'${long}'#class=$1'${assoc[$long]}'#g;'
    cssreplacer=$cssreplacer's#\.'${long}'#.'${assoc[$long]}'#g;'
done

sizeof() {
    stat --format="%s" "$*"
}

for fic in $webdir/**/*.{html,xml}(N); do
    before=$(sizeof $fic)
    print -n -- "$fic ($before"
    perl -pi -e $htmlreplacer $fic
    after=$(sizeof $fic)
    print -- " => $after [$(( ((before - after) * 100) / before  ))])"
done
for fic in $webdir/**/*.css(N); do
    before=$(sizeof $fic)
    print -n -- "$fic ($before"
    perl -pi  -e $cssreplacer $fic
    after=$(sizeof $fic)
    print -- " => $after [$(( ((before - after) * 100) / before  ))])"
done
```

A few remarks:

* to prevent doing the work twice, the script only takes care for classe
  names longer or equal to 3 chars. (=awk 'length($2)>2 {print
  length($2),$2}'=). As consequence take care that your website does not
  use class name shorter than 3 chars otherwise it could mess with your css.
* The script do not change ids because those can be used for anchors and
  thus can be part of public URLs.
* The script replace the classes with the longuest name first to prevent
  bug if one class name is a prefix of another one.
* We generate a long perl script to launch perl just once, this make the
  full find and replace way faster.

Of course this could be improved by providing the shortest name to the most
used classes, and also by using a better =shortName= function that could
use more chars.
But just this quick and dirty script already does a better work than
existing methods that do not take into account all the CSS and HTML files.

<title>Further Blog Engine change</title>

# Further Blog Engine change
author:  Yann Esposito
email:  yann@esposito.host
=> /files/publickey.txt gpg
date:  [2019-11-30 Sat]
keywords:  blog
description:  About recent changes on my blog system.

When I started this new blog, I wanted to find something minimal to be able
to minimize my natural tendency to hack my blogging system.

Clearly it was a failure :), =org-publish= ecosystem is not easy enough to
handle all my needs, so I had to hack a few external scripts.
In particular regarding RSS.

Here are a few recent changes I did in my system:

1. I changed how I reduce the size of the images.
2. I do not merge all CSS styles in the same CSS file, I splitted 4
   different CSS each supporting light/dark theme.
   This way the size of each page is reduced.
3. I added an HTML minimize step. I could optimize this a lot I think.
4. I added a script that show the size of each webpage (HTML + CSS +
   Images). There is an example in all the footers of the pages of my website.

So to compress the images I use:

```bash
convert src.jpg \
        -resize 400x400\> \
        -colorspace Gray \
        -ordered-dither o8x8,8 \
        dst.jpg
```

Somehow, I made 4 themes.
This is too much, but, I don't know I guess I felt inspired.
I'm particularly proud of the matrix theme (sci dark, try it by selecting
sci and then choose dark theme).
It takes care of making the images green, and inspired by this one I also
added this trick to all other themes.

To note, one of the theme is a minimal one.
It is used to minimize the size of the CSS, while I'm writting those lines,
the css size is 728 bytes.

I'll certainly be able to optimize a lot more the size of my HTML files too.
But I haven't invested much time in it yet. I just use the =minify= command
line tool for them.

So right now to build my website here is the script I use:

name:  build.sh
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# build the files via emacs
emacs \
  --load project.el \
  --eval "(progn (org-publish \"blog\" t) (evil-quit))"

echo "Optim HTML size"
./optim-html.sh
echo "Gen themes clones"
./dup-for-themes.sh
echo "Update file size"
./update-file-size.sh
echo "Building RSS"
./mkrss.sh
echo "RSS Built"
```

Where

name:  optim-html.sh
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env nix-shell
#!nix-shell -i zsh
#!nix-shell -I nixpkgs="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/19.09.tar.gz"

webdir="_site"

debug () {
 print -- $* >/dev/null
}

type -a filelist
setopt extendedglob
if (($#>0)); then
    filelist=( $* )
else
    filelist=( $webdir/**/*.html(.) )
fi

tmp=$(mktemp)

for fic in $filelist; do
    if echo $fic|egrep -- '-(mk|min|sci|modern).html$'>/dev/null; then
        continue
    fi
    print -n -- "$fic "
    cp $fic $tmp; minify --mime text/html $tmp > $fic
    print "[OK]"
done
```

name:  dup-for-themes.sh
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env nix-shell
#!nix-shell -i zsh
#!nix-shell -I nixpkgs="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/19.09.tar.gz"

webdir="_site"

debug () {
 print -- $* >/dev/null
}

if (($#>0)); then
    filelist=( $* )
else
    filelist=( $webdir/**/*.html(.) )
fi

trans(){
   local suff=$1;
   local fic=$2;
   cat $fic | perl -p -e 's#href="?/css/mk.css"?#href=/css/'$suff'.css#;s#(/?(index|archive|slides|about-me)).html#$1-'$suff'.html#g;s#(posts/[a-zA-Z0-9_-]*).html#$1-'$suff'.html#g;s#-'$suff'.html>mk#.html>mk#g' > ${fic:r}-${suff}.html
}

for fic in $filelist; do
    if echo $fic|egrep -- '-(mk|min|sci|modern).html$'>/dev/null; then
        continue
    fi
    print -n -- "$fic "
    for suff in sci min modern; do
        trans $suff $fic
    done
    print "[OK]"
done
```

and the script to write the size of the file inside the file:

name:  update-file-size.sh
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env nix-shell
#!nix-shell -i zsh
#!nix-shell -I nixpkgs="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/19.09.tar.gz"

webdir="_site"

sizeof() {
    stat --format="%s" "$*"
}

debug () {
 print -- $* >/dev/null
}

toh () {
    numfmt --to=iec $*
}

tmpdir=$(mktemp -d)

type -a filelist
if (($#>0)); then
    filelist=( $* )
else
    filelist=( $webdir/**/*.html(.) )
fi

for fic in $filelist; do
    print -n -- "$fic   "

    htmlsize=$(sizeof $fic)
    debug HTML: $htmlsize

    xfic=$tmpdir/$fic
    mkdir -p $(dirname $xfic)
    hxclean $fic > $xfic

    images=( $( < $xfic hxselect -i -c -s '\n' 'img::attr(src)' | sed 's/^\.\.\///' ) )
    imgsize=0
    nbimg=0
    for i in $images; do

        isize=$( sizeof ${fic:h}/$i )
        debug $i '=>' $isize
        (( imgsize += isize ))
    done
    debug IMG: $imgsize

    css=( $( < $xfic hxselect -i -c -s '\n' 'link[rel=stylesheet]::attr(href)'))
    csssize=0
    for i in $css; do
        isize=$( sizeof $webdir/$i )
        debug $i '=>' $isize
        (( csssize += isize ))
    done
    debug CSS: $csssize
    total=$(( htmlsize + imgsize + csssize ))
    sizeinfos=$(print -- "Size: $(toh $total) (HTML: $(toh $htmlsize), CSS: $(toh $csssize), IMG: $(toh $imgsize))")
    print -- $sizeinfos
