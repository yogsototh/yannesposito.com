In Haskell, types are strong and static.

Why is this important? It will help you _greatly_ to avoid mistakes.
In Haskell, most bugs are caught during the compilation of your program.
And the main reason is because of the type inference during compilation.
It will be easy to detect where you used the wrong parameter at the wrong place for example.


<h4 id="type-inference">Type inference</h4>

Static typing is generally essential to reach fast execution time.
But most statically typed languages are bad at generalizing concepts.
Haskell's saving grace is that it can _infer_ types.

Here is a simple example. 
The `square` function in Haskell:

<code class="haskell">
square x = x * x
</code>

This function can `square` any Numeral type.
You can provide `square` with an `Int`, an `Integer`, a `Float` a `Fractional` and even `Complex`. Proof by example:

~~~
% ghci
GHCi, version 7.0.4:
...
Prelude> let square x = x*x
Prelude> square 2
4
Prelude> square 2.1
4.41
Prelude> -- load the Data.Complex module
Prelude> :m Data.Complex
Prelude Data.Complex> square (2 :+ 1)
3.0 :+ 4.0
~~~

`x :+ y` is the notation for the complex (<i>x + ib</i>).

Now compare with the amount of code necessary in C:

<code class="c">
int     int_square(int x) { return x*x; }

float   float_square(float x) {return x*x; }

complex complex_square (complex z) {
    complex tmp; 
    tmp.real = z.real * z.real - z.img * z.img;
    tmp.img = 2 * z.img * z.real;
}

complex x,y;
y = complex_square(x);
</code>

For each type, you need to write a new function.
The only way to work around this problem is to use some meta-programming trick.
For example using the pre-processor.
In C++ there is a better way, the C++ templates:

<code class="c++">
#include <iostream>
#include <complex>
using namespace std;

template<typename T>
T square(T x)
{
    return x*x;
}

int main() {
    // int
    int sqr_of_five = square(5);
    cout << sqr_of_five << endl;
    // double
    cout << (double)square(5.3) << endl;
    // complex
    cout << square( complex<double>(5,3) ) 
         << endl;
    return 0;
}
</code>

C++ does a far better job than C. 
For more complex function the syntax can be hard to follow:
look at 
[this article](http://bartoszmilewski.com/2009/10/21/what-does-haskell-have-to-do-with-c/) 
for example.

In C++ you must declare that a function can work with different types.
In Haskell this is the opposite. 
The function will be as general as possible by default.

Type inference gives Haskell the feeling of freedom that dynamically
typed languages provide. 
But unlike dynamically typed languages, most errors are caught before the execution.
Generally, in Haskell:

 > "if it compiles it certainly does what you intended"
