If you are still waiting a reply from me.
Don't take it personally.
After reading "Digital Minimalism"[fn:dm] I decided to drastically protect
myself against most real-time notifications.

I try to look at my email everyday.
But it is not unusual I can skip a few days without checking any notification.

So I'll answer, it can just take a lot of time.

My preferred way to be contacted is via encrypted email.
This will certainly be the best way for me to notice you among notifications.

## Work


I'm a functional programmer, working remotely for Cisco.
More precisely my current position is /lead software engineer/ for a fully remote team.

My domains of expertise are:
* Clojure programming (API)
* code architecture with a strong accent put on composability
* Authentication & Authorization system, in particular OAuth2/OpenID Connect
  (I've built an entire quite complex and advanced OAuth2/OpenID Connect
  Provider at Cisco).
