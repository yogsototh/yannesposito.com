I have never seen another film/TV show with a similar atmosphere. The usage of bright colors is magistral. Flashy yellow, green, red.<p>The <strong>soundtrack</strong> is also pretty surprising original and enjoyable.<p>The <strong>acting</strong> is really great. Actors are doing a great job and are quite relatable. These are not the (super)heroes you are used to. We are far away from shows where every girl is a bimbo and every guy is a Chippendale.<p>The <strong>scenario</strong>, in regard to the recent events related to COVID19 is just perfect. I do not want to reveal too much. But let's just say the current real events are close to the events predicted in this show.<p>The <strong>Surrealistic Humor</strong> atmosphere make the viewing experience quite exceptionnal. There is a mix between nonchalance and extreme violence. It really feels surrealist. In this show some people act with extreme violence as if there is no choice.<p>As a conclusion, if you are looking for a very innovative TV show then search no further this one is a great original choice. If you are still unsure, just watch the opening scene, it is quite incredible.<p>ps: Also try to get the original content. Amazon Prime apparently cut some very important scene and also changed the ratio which hurt the very good image work.</article></main><footer id=postamble class=status><div class=content><nav role=navigation><a href=/index.html>Home</a> |
