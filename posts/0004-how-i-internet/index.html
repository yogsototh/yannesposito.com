A popular meme about it states:<blockquote><ul><li>toilet ⇒ 5min<li>toilet + smarphone ⇒ 55min</ul></blockquote><p>The book Digital Minimalism<a href=#fn6 class=h id=fnref6 role=doc-noteref><sup>6</sup></a> is really insightful on the subject. In particular the apparition of attention grabbing features that target our "social brain".<p>One solution to protect ourselves from the problem generated by these platforms would be to get rid of them. But those platforms are useful.<p>My current<a href=#fn7 class=h id=fnref7 role=doc-noteref><sup>7</sup></a> personal solution is to keep the useful features of these platforms while minimizing my exposition to most <em>anti-features</em>. Everything starts by how I produce content. It then affects how I consume Internet.<h1 id=producing>Producing</h1><p>I self-host many services. I control my data, and then I broadcast those info to different platforms. This is called POSSE<a href=#fn8 class=h id=fnref8 role=doc-noteref><sup>8</sup></a>.<h2 id=self-hosting>Articles: self-hosted blog</h2><p>First thing the classical <em>blog</em>.<p>It is more and more common now, to simply use micro-blogging, or commenting. I think blog article format is important. It is a longer form than a comment or a tweet. But in the same time, it is not necessary to work on it as hard as for a journal article.<p>I wrote an <a href=new-blog.org>article</a> that explain the technical details behind my blog. It also describes how I try to make it <em>respectful</em>.<p>To self-host anything, you should buy a domain name, and configure you DNS correctly. That is certainly the biggest blocker for non technical people.<h2 id=git-broadcast>Code: Git Broadcast</h2><p>I self-host the code of my open-source projects. As Github is the de-facto developer social network, it is easier to find contributor on Github than on your self-hosted repository.<p>Thus I sync my repositories between my self-hosted instance and GitHub. If something goes wrong with Github, I could easily switch to my self hosted repositories only.<p>This is how I configured my git repos to push to multiple URLs:<pre><code>git remote set-url origin --push --add &lt;remote-url&gt;
git remote set-url origin --push --add &lt;another-remote-url&gt;
</code></pre><h2 id=espial>Bookmarks: Espial</h2><p>I also wanted a tool to keep track of web pages I like and might want to keep track of. For that, I self-host <a href=https://espial.esy.fun/u:yogsototh>espial</a><a href=#fn9 class=h id=fnref9 role=doc-noteref><sup>9</sup></a>; an open-source, web-based bookmarking server.<p>It is a very easy to install, this is a single binary. Your bookmark are kept in a single sqlite file.<p>This is perfect if you want to keep a lot of bookmarks some private some public. But as well as I use espial I plan (I haven't done it yet) to synchronize my bookmark from espial<a href=#fn10 class=h id=fnref10 role=doc-noteref><sup>10</sup></a> to pinboard<a href=#fn11 class=h id=fnref11 role=doc-noteref><sup>11</sup></a>.<h2 id=notes--espial>Notes: Espial</h2><p>Another feature provided by espial<a href=#fn12 class=h id=fnref12 role=doc-noteref><sup>12</sup></a> is the ability to save <a href=https://espial.esy.fun/u:yogsototh/notes>notes</a>.<p>You can generate public or private notes. I intend to use those notes for my "micro-blogging" needs. Useful, for just making some short remark without investing in a full blog post.<h2 id=rss>RSS for articles, bookmarks, notes</h2><p>It is important for me to provide RSS feeds. People should know when I update my content.<p>So my blog, bookmarks and note generate RSS feeds<a href=#fn13 class=h id=fnref13 role=doc-noteref><sup>13</sup></a>.<h2 id=node-red>Syndicate Elsewhere: node-red</h2><p>With those RSS, it is then quite natural to syndicate elsewhere. For that I use node-red<a href=#fn14 class=h id=fnref14 role=doc-noteref><sup>14</sup></a>.<p>This is a web-based tool that make it easy to write <em>flows</em>. Think about it like a super IFTTT.<p>To give you an example, each time I save a new public bookmark, a new blog post, a new note, I tweet it.<h1 id=consuming>Consuming</h1><p>Since I generate my content using my own, self-made environment, it also influenced me for the best the way I consume and interact on Internet.<p>Before I used to read a lot of <em>news</em> directly from my smartphone. Most of the time using many apps dedicated to some social networks.<p>The natural presentation is an infinite scroll of content, with buttons to engage in the social network with likes/upvotes/comments etc… Most of the time, notifications where enabled by fear of missing a comment or any kind of interaction.<p>Before explaining how I consume Internet news, I like to make a short digression:<blockquote><p>By writing this article I realized that, I mostly consume Internet content via <strong>news</strong>. More than that, now, Internet is almost synonymous to news on the Web. Which is only a very small part of the Internet.<p>Consuming news via a social networks makes you a lot more passive. I can remember being a lot more active on the Internet just a few years ago.<p>This is something to keep in mind I think. I will certainly write an article about that in the future.</blockquote><p>Here is how I consume Internet content now.<h2 id=news>News</h2><p>My entry point to news consumption are:<ul><li>highly selected RSS sources (for example HN posts with > 500 upvotes)<li><a href=https://lobste.rs>lobste.rs</a><li><a href=https://pinboard.in/popular/>popular pinboard.in bookmarks</a><li>very few sub-reddit with small volume<li><a href=https://laarc.io>laarc.io</a><li><a href=https://fermatslibrary.com>Fermat's Library newsletter</a></ul><p>I plan on generating RSS from those different sources with "smart filters". Typically number of upvote filters for lobste.rs, laarc.io, sub-reddits, but also number of bookmarks in popular pinboard, etc…<p>My preferred <em>Internet consumption environment</em> is elfeed<a href=#fn15 class=h id=fnref15 role=doc-noteref><sup>15</sup></a> inside Spacemacs. I really enjoy staying inside emacs as much as I can. This is a clean, dense, text-oriented environment.<p>I also use elfeed-org<a href=#fn16 class=h id=fnref16 role=doc-noteref><sup>16</sup></a> to organize my feeds and I also take care to remove feeds with too much volume. Generally we shouldn't read more than a few articles a day.<h2 id=mail>Mail</h2><p>Most of my notifications go through my email. Social network notifications are moved inside a dedicated folder and are not directly present in my inbox. I check my social notifications once in a while. So if you are waiting for an answer, sorry for the late reply, it might take a while.<h2 id=github>Github</h2><p>I still get notifications on Github because I use it a lot for my work. But only via email and the web interface. So even for Github, I can take a few days to react.<h1 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h1><p>I described how I control my usage of social networks. I own my data. I am a lot less exposed to attention grabbing techniques.<p>For now I'm quite happy with the system I made, and I'll certainly improve it in the future by synchronizing more and more services between a self-hosted one and a social-network one.<p>I really advice anyone with sufficient tehcnical skills to do the same. This is really worth your time.<p>For other people, I know some platform intented to be self-hosted and here to provide a bunch of services for you. But having a self made environment also enhance greatly the experience. And really, self-hosting is still reserved to few people.<p>I think we could be inspired by espial<a href=#fn17 class=h id=fnref17 role=doc-noteref><sup>17</sup></a> to create a simple small platform to provide those feature to most people.<ul><li>ability to blog/micro-blog and syndicate<li>ability to publish securely private info to a small group of friends and family<li>generate RSS feeds for different groups of people</ul><h2 id=federation>Federation</h2><p>I think I can say a few words about federated networks like Mastodon. Somehow, Mastodon replicates the anti-features promoted by Twitter or Facebook.<p>Furthermore I don't really like some details about the federation foundations (ActivityPub).<p>As an example, I wrote a commenting system that I could easily self-host. I first intended to use it for my blog. But after a second though, I'm not sure comments are that positive. I prefer to edit my articles with comments that people would send to me via other communication channel, typically, my mail.<h2 id=anti-features>Anti-features</h2><p>A last note about anti-features. I call <em>anti-feature</em> a feature that provides very few or no benefit for the user but provides a lot more benefits to the platform. Generally it is a feature just here to make you stay on the platform and many quite talented specialists work on optimizing those.<p>Most anti-features share the same pattern; they use <em>spaced random reward</em>:<div class=bj><p><strong>Spaced Random Reward</strong><p>Typically the few first random gifts in a new downloaded game. The main way used to <em>hack</em> your brain, is by giving it something he likes at a random time. Then you start to give reward with lower and lower probability. Your brain will then be in a <em>search mode</em> where he will <em>hope</em> to get another reward by staying a bit longer in the system.</div><ul><li><strong>notifications</strong> ; they are here to grab your attention when you are away doing something else.<li><strong>likes / upvotes / retweets / pokes…</strong> ; those are also <em>Internet reward</em> but are even stronger because they also target your "social brain". They reinforce a feeling of social approval. More than that, we generally fall for most psychological tricks with those and make our production oriented to short content, memes, etc…<li><strong>infinite scrolling</strong> ; make you brain want to look a bit more, because it creates a fear to miss something.<li><strong>comments</strong> ; Unlike likes or retweets, comments are a lot more useful, they can start a discussion. They still have two problems:<ol><li>Public comment are subject to spam, troll, attacks, etc…<li>Generally comments are associated to real-time notifications, and thus break a slower, calmer, more respectful communication channel. We are not all meant to react instantaneously.</ol></ul><section class=u role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn1 role=doc-endnote><p><a href=https://indieweb.org/POSSE>https://indieweb.org/POSSE</a><a href=#fnref1 class=d role=doc-backlink>↩︎</a><li id=fn2 role=doc-endnote><p><a href=https://github.com/jonschoning/espial>https://github.com/jonschoning/espial</a><a href=#fnref2 class=d role=doc-backlink>↩︎</a><li id=fn3 role=doc-endnote><p><a href=https://nodered.org>https://nodered.org</a><a href=#fnref3 class=d role=doc-backlink>↩︎</a><li id=fn4 role=doc-endnote><p><a href=https://pinboard.in>https://pinboard.in</a><a href=#fnref4 class=d role=doc-backlink>↩︎</a><li id=fn5 role=doc-endnote><p><a href=http://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/>http://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/</a><a href=#fnref5 class=d role=doc-backlink>↩︎</a><li id=fn6 role=doc-endnote><p><a href=http://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/>http://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/</a><a href=#fnref6 class=d role=doc-backlink>↩︎</a><li id=fn7 role=doc-endnote><p>Writing this article helped me to improve a lot my workflow, and I will continue to make my Internet usage evolve for a long time.<a href=#fnref7 class=d role=doc-backlink>↩︎</a><li id=fn8 role=doc-endnote><p><a href=https://indieweb.org/POSSE>https://indieweb.org/POSSE</a><a href=#fnref8 class=d role=doc-backlink>↩︎</a><li id=fn9 role=doc-endnote><p><a href=https://github.com/jonschoning/espial>https://github.com/jonschoning/espial</a><a href=#fnref9 class=d role=doc-backlink>↩︎</a><li id=fn10 role=doc-endnote><p><a href=https://github.com/jonschoning/espial>https://github.com/jonschoning/espial</a><a href=#fnref10 class=d role=doc-backlink>↩︎</a><li id=fn11 role=doc-endnote><p><a href=https://pinboard.in>https://pinboard.in</a><a href=#fnref11 class=d role=doc-backlink>↩︎</a><li id=fn12 role=doc-endnote><p><a href=https://github.com/jonschoning/espial>https://github.com/jonschoning/espial</a><a href=#fnref12 class=d role=doc-backlink>↩︎</a><li id=fn13 role=doc-endnote><p><a href=https://github.com/jonschoning/espial>espial</a> is written in Haskell, and I made a few pull requests to add RSS feeds of my public bookmarks as well as an RSS feed for my public notes.<a href=#fnref13 class=d role=doc-backlink>↩︎</a><li id=fn14 role=doc-endnote><p><a href=https://nodered.org>https://nodered.org</a><a href=#fnref14 class=d role=doc-backlink>↩︎</a><li id=fn15 role=doc-endnote><p><a href=https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed>https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed</a><a href=#fnref15 class=d role=doc-backlink>↩︎</a><li id=fn16 role=doc-endnote><p><a href=https://github.com/remyhonig/elfeed-org>https://github.com/remyhonig/elfeed-org</a><a href=#fnref16 class=d role=doc-backlink>↩︎</a><li id=fn17 role=doc-endnote><p><a href=https://github.com/jonschoning/espial>https://github.com/jonschoning/espial</a><a href=#fnref17 class=d role=doc-backlink>↩︎</a></ol></section></div><div id=postamble class=ar><div class=al><nav><a href=/index.html>Home</a> |
