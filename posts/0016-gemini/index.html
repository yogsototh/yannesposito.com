<a href=https://her.esy.fun><span class=az>Yann Esposito</span>'s blog</a></div><div class=z>How I discovered gemini</div></div></div><div id=content><p>This weekend I read an article about gopher and gemini. I already seen articles about gemini pass. Somehow, it was more appealing to me than gopher space for totally subjective reasons I think. Anyway this time I really dug into it, and I loved the experience.<p>At first sight gemini is like a parallel web for nerds. It has fundamental changes that I would have really liked to see from the modern web. The client decide the design, no user tracking, calm, minimalist, simple.<p>Right now, on the web, most news website make the experience terrible to read the article. The page is bloated with a lot of animations, popin asking you to accept the cookies, ads with videos, strange fonts or design, plenty of javascript, trackers, etc…<p>Gemini make those kind of anti-design impractical. In gemini space there is no:<ul><li>CSS: the client decide the look of the page, the fonts, the colors, the width of the columns, etc…<li>inline image: you can still link to images, but images should not be displayed in the middle of the text.<li>inline links: If you link to an external resource, it is clearly visible as an element on its own line.<li>cookies<li>HTTP headers used to track users<li>scripts on the client side<li>hard to parse format (no HTML, XHTML, etc…)</ul><p>Another strength of Gemini is its protocol's simplicity. It is easy to write your own gemini server as well as your own gemini client within a few hours of work in your programming language of choice.<p>And last but not least, gemini is unfit to serve "big" files. So we should not experience people going to gemini for music/movie piracy. If you want to serve "big" files you should use another protocol.<p>Personally I started to browse gemini directly from emacs with elpher. But I know there are a lot of clients.<p>I liked gemini so much I hacked my blog to also publish in the gemini sphere. I serve my pages with a rust based server. And I hacked a quick script to transform my org mode files to gemini format. Gemini file format is a kind of super simplified markdown. I really like the simplicity of it.<p>Here are a few links to get you started.<p>Web:<ul><li><a href=https://gemini.circumlunar.space>gemini homepage</a><li><a href=https://thelambdalab.xyz/elpher/>elpher emacs gopher and gemini client</a><li><a href=https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/gemini.circumlunar.space/>Explore gemini from the web</a></ul><p>Gopher:<ul><li><a href=gopher://thelambdalab.xyz/1/projects/elpher/>elpher</a></ul><p>Gemini:<ul><li><a href=gemini://her.esy.fun>my website in gemini</a></ul></div><div id=postamble class=an><div class=ai><nav><a href=/index.html>Home</a> |
