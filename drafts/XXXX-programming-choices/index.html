How are we creating our preferrences? Why one use vim and the other one can use a specialized IDE?<h1 id=preferences-depends-on-experiences>Preferences depends on experiences</h1><h2 id=hard-to-understand>Hard to understand</h2><h2 id=goals>Goals</h2><h1 id=back-story>Back Story</h1><h2 id=at-first>At first</h2><ul><li>Logo when I was 10yo at school<li>Basic when I was 11yo, with a book trying to draw lines and make games<li>Basic with Amtrad CPC 6128, trying to write games from magasines<li>Compiled Basic with Atari STe, write a game you are the hero in it.<li>Take some courses of beginner Pascal at school, sort algorithms</ul><h2 id=math-background-then-computer-science>Math Background then Computer Science</h2><ul><li>Pascal for algorithmic<li>C, for basics, system and network<li>C++, Eiffel for Object Oriented Programming<li>A little bit of CaML (write a mathematical expression simplifier making big usage of pattern matching)</ul><h2 id=ph.-d.-in-machine-learning>Ph. D. In Machine Learning</h2><ul><li>Give courses of Logo, C, etc…<li>Write lot of complex HMM related algorithms in C++ with quite complex ML algorithms<li>Discover Java and its promises, play a bit with it<li>Have friend that use CaML for its Ph.D. and its hash-maps are said to be faster than C. I remember this.</ul><h2 id=no-love-for-machine-learning-in-2005>No Love for Machine Learning in 2005 :/</h2><ul><li>Write a Java program with an User Interface in my Post Ph. D. 1/2 of the work in the UI, the other half in the algorithm.</ul><h2 id=still-no-love-for-ml-in-2006-find-a-job-just-to-eat>Still no love for ML in 2006 Find a job just to eat</h2><ul><li>Go find a job to eat, have a <strong>lot</strong> of time to learn new things<li>Discover HN, /r/programming, etc…<li>Web Applications are all the rage<li>DCVS is still a thing, people argue between git, mercurial, bazaar, etc…<li>Write a tremendous number of zsh scripts to handle a huge number of files, use Perl, etc…</ul><h2 id=first-try-at-startup>First try at startup</h2><ul><li>Decide with a friend to make a product, choice of technology with them is <u>very</u> hard.<li>git for example was a question<li>using FB connect instead of classical, name / password bullshit is refused because they still live technically in 2000<li>Design decisions are hard to make<li>Programming language, I heard good things about OCaML as the fastest high level language. Can't even talk about it.<li>A guy need technicians to make its product and is willing to pay.<li>OK good first thing to try ourselves.<li>The other guy know Ruby, so let's go with Ruby (no rails)<li>Write our own framework, many technical frictions, but in the end a PoC is made full ruby, deployed on heroku. The product is an end-to-end personal electrical power consumption system.<li>Guy explain, I want "real time"!!!! ???? WTFBBQ!! Real time is way harder than just drawing dashboards!!!!<li>Have performance problems! Start looking into other frameworks, stumble upon snap, an Haskell framework stating that it is <u>very</u> fast.<li>Start looking further into Haskell from there.</ul><h2 id=haskell-learning>Haskell learning</h2><ul><li>Learn Haskell from web programming perspective, the goal is not to <u>learn</u> Haskell but to <u>use</u> Haskell to write as fast as possible a web application with batteries included. After trying a bit, I choose to use Yesod.<li>Lot of time lost due to Yesod difficulties to handle correct package version coherence!!!!<li>cabal freeze, etc… to the rescue, not perfect but ok, able to deploy on heroku<li>Learn Haskell in the process.</ul></div><div id=postamble class=ar><div class=al><nav><a href=/index.html>Home</a> |
