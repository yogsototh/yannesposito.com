Here are my 2cents<h1 id=personal-experience-with-scrum>Personal Experience with Scrum:</h1><h2 id=discovering>Discovering</h2><ul><li>Fear and counter arguments</ul><h2 id=efficiency>Efficiency</h2><ul><li>Time lost in meeting</ul><h2 id=people-tensions>People tensions</h2><ul><li>instead of tamming it made everything worse.</ul><h1 id=management-the-root-of-all-evil>Management: The root of all evil?</h1><p>The root of the problem is between the developpers and the managers.<ul><li>Manager: I want a great product, I want to finish it fast, I want my customers to love it<li>Developer: I want a great product, I want to finish it fast, I want customers to love it</ul><p>What could go wrong?<ul><li><p>What Manager means: <u>I want a great product</u>: I want to sell it!<li><p>What Developer means: <u>I want a great product</u>: I want it to use the last technology, with the last code organization/quality trends<li><p>Manager: <u>I want to finish it fast</u>: I don't want to listen to technical discussion, this looks like something easy to do. It should be in my hand in few weeks.<li><p>Developer: <u>I want to finish it fast</u>: I want to keep the code clean to be able to add new changes fast with confidence (without breaking anything) this certainly means, testing + testing environment + proofs …<li><p>Manager: <u>I want customer to love it</u>: They should buy more and more. The product should be useful.<li><p>Developer: <u>I want customer to love it</u>: User should enjoy using it. The product should be simple, clean, natural, beautiful.</ul><p>The two meaning are'nt completely opposite. Still they are quite different.<h1 id=what-could-we-do-about-it>What could we do about it?</h1><p>How to solve the problem?<ul><li>Spoiler: <u>you can't</u>.</ul><p>The root of all evil is "it looks easy, do it". Proof, a guy made the same thing in PHP in 2003, or I saw the same shit in Flash around 1998.<p>You have two choices:<ol><li>Use tools to finish your work fast, but the cost is very to maintain and modify.<li>Use tools that enforce quality, you'll have a starting cost.</ol><p>Error not to do:<ul><li>Manager ask for something, you use your l337 H4X0R cape and you show him something in less than 10 minutes.<li>Manager believe that everything should be as fast<li>Discover what you did was just a terrible hack, and take 2 days to finish it correctly.<li>Manager doesn't really understand why he <u>saw</u> it right now, and has to wait many days to really have it in production.</ul></div><div id=postamble class=ar><div class=al><nav><a href=/index.html>Home</a> |
